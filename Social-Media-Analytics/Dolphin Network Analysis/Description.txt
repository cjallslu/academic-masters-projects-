This report analyzes a network consisting of 62 dolphins. The degree, closeness, betweeness, and eigen centralities are analyzed, as well as other terms such as transitivity, path length, cliques, and structural holes. Through this study of the dolphin network, we can gain new network insights and relate the animal behavior to human behavior. An example is studying managerial positions by observing the dolphin pack leader.
