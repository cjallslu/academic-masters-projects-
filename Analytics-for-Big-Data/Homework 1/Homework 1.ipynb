They attacked him\\n', 'in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\\n', 'distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at\\n', 'last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\\n', 'Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\\n', 'delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\n', 'agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\\n', 'with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\\n', 'dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\\n', \"hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.\\n\", '\\n', '\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\"\\n', 'said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the others equally well\\n', 'married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\n', '\\n', \"In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about\\n\", 'ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\\n', 'admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had\\n', 'heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\\n', 'fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper\\n', 'window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\n', '\\n', 'An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already\\n', 'had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\\n', 'housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\\n', 'was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable\\n', 'to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\\n', 'disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\\n', 'so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\\n', 'he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\\n', 'settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears\\n', 'a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get\\n', 'a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley\\n', 'was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\\n', 'The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the\\n', 'day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only\\n', 'six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when\\n', 'the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five\\n', 'altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and\\n', 'another young man.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\n', 'countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\\n', 'with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\\n', 'looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\\n', 'of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\\n', 'the report which was in general circulation within five minutes\\n', 'after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\\n', 'pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he\\n', 'was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\\n', 'admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\\n', 'which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\\n', 'proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all\\n', 'his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\n', 'forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\\n', 'with his friend.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\\n', 'people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\\n', 'was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving\\n', 'one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\\n', 'themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\\n', 'only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\\n', 'introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\\n', 'walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\n', 'His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\n', 'in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\\n', 'Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\\n', 'his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\n', 'having slighted one of her daughters.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\\n', 'down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\\n', 'standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\\n', 'Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend\\n', 'to join it.\\n', '\\n', '\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\n', 'standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\\n', 'dance.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\n', 'particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this\\n', 'it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\\n', 'another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\\n', 'stand up with.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley, \"for a\\n', 'kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in\\n', 'my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\\n', 'uncommonly pretty.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr.\\n', 'Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\\n', 'of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\\n', 'dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a moment at\\n', 'Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\\n', '\"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no\\n', 'humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\\n', 'by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\\n', 'smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\\n', 'remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,\\n', 'however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\n', 'playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\\n', '\\n', 'The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\\n', 'party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\\n', 'distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as\\n', \"her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's\\n\", 'pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\n', 'accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\n', 'fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they\\n', 'had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\n', 'spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\n', 'were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With\\n', 'a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\n', 'good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\n', \"such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on\\n\", 'the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a\\n', 'different story to hear.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most\\n', 'delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\\n', 'Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\\n', 'she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\n', 'her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her\\n', 'twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\n', 'time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\n', 'up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\\n', 'can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\n', 'down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\n', 'asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,\\n', 'and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,\\n', 'and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If he had had any compassion for _me_,\" cried her husband impatiently,\\n', '\"he would not have danced half so much! For God\\'s sake, say no more of\\n', 'his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\\n', 'handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw\\n', 'anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.\\n', 'Hurst\\'s gown--\"\\n', '\\n', 'Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\n', 'description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\n', 'of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\\n', 'exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n', '\\n', '\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\n', 'suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\n', 'all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\\n', 'him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\\n', 'great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\\n', 'dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 4\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\\n', 'her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very\\n', 'much she admired him.\\n', '\\n', '\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\n', 'good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much\\n', 'ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man ought\\n', 'likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\\n', 'did not expect such a compliment.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between\\n', 'us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\\n', 'could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\\n', 'seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman\\n', 'in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\\n', 'very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\\n', 'stupider person.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\\n', 'You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\\n', 'in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your\\n', 'life.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\\n', 'what I think.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\\n', 'good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\\n', 'others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it\\n', 'everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the\\n', \"good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing\\n\", \"of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,\\n\", 'too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you\\n', 'converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\\n', 'his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\\n', 'neighbour in her.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\\n', 'the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\\n', 'quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,\\n', 'and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she\\n', 'was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine\\n', 'ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the\\n', 'power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\n', 'conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the\\n', 'first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\n', 'pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of\\n', 'associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect\\n', 'entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of\\n', 'a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\\n', \"impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their\\n\", 'own had been acquired by trade.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\n', 'thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\\n', 'estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\\n', 'sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\\n', 'good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\\n', 'who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\n', 'remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\\n', 'purchase.\\n', '\\n', 'His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\\n', 'though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\\n', 'means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\\n', 'married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\\n', 'his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\\n', 'age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation\\n', 'to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for\\n', 'half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal\\n', 'rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it\\n', 'immediately.\\n', '\\n', 'Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of\\n', 'great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\\n', 'easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\\n', 'could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\\n', \"never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley\\n\", 'had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.\\n', 'In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\\n', 'deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\\n', 'reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not\\n', 'inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\\n', 'was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\n', 'giving offense.\\n', '\\n', 'The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\\n', 'characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or\\n', 'prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive\\n', 'to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt\\n', 'acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not\\n', 'conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a\\n', 'collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\\n', 'none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received\\n', 'either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\n', 'but she smiled too much.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\\n', 'her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one\\n', 'whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\\n', 'established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such\\n', 'commendation to think of her as he chose.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 5\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\\n', 'were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\\n', 'in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\\n', 'honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.\\n', 'The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a\\n', 'disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;\\n', 'and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house\\n', 'about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,\\n', 'where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,\\n', 'unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all\\n', 'the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\\n', 'supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By\\n', 'nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.\\n', \"James's had made him courteous.\\n\", '\\n', 'Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\n', 'valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\\n', 'of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\\n', \"Elizabeth's intimate friend.\\n\", '\\n', 'That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over\\n', 'a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\\n', 'brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\\n', '\\n', '\"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet with civil\\n', 'self-command to Miss Lucas. \"_You_ were Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\\n', 'sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he\\n', '_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\\n', 'about Mr. Robinson.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not\\n', \"I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton\\n\", 'assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many\\n', 'pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\\n', \"answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\\n\", 'beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\\'\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as\\n', 'if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\" said\\n', 'Charlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\\n', 'is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by his\\n', 'ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite\\n', 'a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\\n', 'sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Are you quite sure, ma\\'am?--is not there a little mistake?\" said Jane.\\n', '\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\\n', 'could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at\\n', 'being spoke to.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much,\\n', 'unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably\\n', 'agreeable.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\n', 'agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\\n', 'was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\\n', 'heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to\\n', 'the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas, \"but I\\n', 'wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance with _him_,\\n', 'if I were you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I believe, ma\\'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend _me_ so much as pride\\n', 'often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\\n', 'very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\\n', 'should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\\n', 'to be proud.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive\\n', '_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\\n', 'reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\\n', 'ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\\n', 'nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\\n', 'who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\\n', 'quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\\n', 'things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may\\n', 'be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\\n', 'ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who came with\\n', 'his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\\n', 'foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\\n', 'directly.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\\n', 'would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 6\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\\n', \"was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on\\n\", 'the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\\n', 'found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\\n', 'a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards\\n', 'the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest\\n', 'pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment\\n', 'of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\\n', 'though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\n', \"all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It\\n\", 'was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and\\n', 'to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\\n', 'which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\n', 'way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\\n', 'was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\\n', 'united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\\n', 'uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions\\n', 'of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\n', '\\n', '\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to impose\\n', 'on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\\n', 'so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\\n', 'from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\\n', 'it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in\\n', 'the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\\n', 'attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\\n', '_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\\n', 'very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\\n', 'encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_\\n', 'affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\\n', 'may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can\\n', 'perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to\\n', 'discover it too.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as you do.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\\n', 'it, he must find it out.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane\\n', 'meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they\\n', 'always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\\n', 'every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\\n', 'therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his\\n', 'attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for\\n', 'falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in\\n', 'question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined\\n', 'to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\\n', \"these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,\\n\", 'she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its\\n', 'reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\\n', 'dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\\n', 'and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite\\n', 'enough to make her understand his character.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\\n', 'only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\\n', 'remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four\\n', 'evenings may do a great deal.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they\\n', 'both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\\n', 'leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and\\n', 'if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\\n', 'chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\\n', 'twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\\n', 'the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or\\n', 'ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\\n', 'least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\\n', 'have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\\n', 'possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\\n', 'life.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\\n', 'sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth\\n\", 'was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\\n', 'interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\\n', 'allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\\n', 'ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\\n', 'sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly\\n', 'had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\n', 'uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\\n', 'this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\\n', 'detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\\n', 'in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\\n', 'pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\\n', 'of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\\n', 'this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made\\n', 'himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\\n', 'to dance with.\\n', '\\n', 'He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\\n', 'with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\\n', \"drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were\\n\", 'assembled.\\n', '\\n', '\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by listening to my\\n', 'conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\\n', 'what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\\n', 'being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\"\\n', '\\n', 'On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\\n', 'any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\\n', 'a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\\n', 'turned to him and said:\\n', '\\n', '\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\\n', 'well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\\n', 'Meryton?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\n', 'energetic.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You are severe on us.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas. \"I am going\\n', 'to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\\n', 'to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken\\n', 'a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\\n', 'really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\\n', 'hearing the very best performers.\" On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however,\\n', 'she added, \"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely glancing\\n', 'at Mr. Darcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\\n', \"course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I\\n\", 'shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\\n', 'or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that\\n', 'she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\\n', 'sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\\n', 'the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\\n', 'impatient for display.\\n', '\\n', 'Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\\n', 'application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\\n', 'manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\\n', 'had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\\n', 'much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\\n', 'end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\\n', 'Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,\\n', 'with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\\n', 'dancing at one end of the room.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\n', 'passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\\n', 'much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was\\n', 'his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\n', '\\n', '\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There\\n', 'is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first\\n', 'refinements of polished society.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\\n', 'the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Sir William only smiled. \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\\n', 'continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I doubt\\n', 'not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\\n', 'you often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Never, sir.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Darcy bowed.\\n', '\\n', '\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond\\n', 'of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\\n', 'London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed\\n', 'to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\\n', 'struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\\n', 'her:\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\\n', 'me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\\n', 'cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\"\\n', 'And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though\\n', 'extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\\n', 'drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\\n', 'not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\\n', 'her hand, but in vain.

They insist also on my seeing Mr.\\n', 'Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been\\n', 'to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\\n', 'matter with me.--Yours, etc.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\\n', 'aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\\n', 'should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\\n', 'Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling\\n', 'colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is\\n', 'all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though\\n', 'the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking\\n', 'was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\\n', '\\n', '\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such a\\n', 'thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\\n', 'there.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the\\n', 'horses?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing\\n', 'when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but every\\n', 'impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\\n', 'exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and Lydia.\\n', 'Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\\n', 'together.\\n', '\\n', '\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps we may\\n', 'see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\\n', \"of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\\n\", 'field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\\n', 'over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\\n', 'within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face\\n', 'glowing with the warmth of exercise.\\n', '\\n', 'She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\\n', 'assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\\n', 'That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such\\n', 'dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\\n', 'Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\\n', 'for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\\n', \"brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there\\n\", 'was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\\n', 'Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\\n', 'brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as\\n', \"to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\n\", 'thinking only of his breakfast.\\n', '\\n', 'Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\\n', 'Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not\\n', 'well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\\n', 'immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\\n', 'alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed\\n', 'for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\\n', 'however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them\\n', 'together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\\n', 'extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\\n', 'her.\\n', '\\n', 'When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\\n', 'began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\\n', 'solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having\\n', 'examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught\\n', 'a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\\n', 'advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\\n', 'was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\\n', 'ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\\n', 'the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in\\n', 'fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\n', '\\n', 'When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\\n', 'unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\\n', 'wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\\n', 'in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\\n', 'of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\\n', 'Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to\\n', 'Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply\\n', 'of clothes.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 8\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\\n\", 'Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\\n', 'poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\\n', \"much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very\\n\", 'favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\\n', 'this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\\n', 'shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\\n', 'being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\n', 'indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored\\n', 'Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\n', '\\n', 'Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\\n', 'regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\\n', 'attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\\n', 'herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\\n', 'others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\\n', 'engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\\n', 'Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\\n', 'eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain\\n', 'dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\n', '\\n', 'When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\\n', 'began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\\n', 'pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;\\n', 'she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the\\n', 'same, and added:\\n', '\\n', '\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\\n', 'walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\\n', 'looked almost wild.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\\n', 'nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\\n', 'country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\\n', 'in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\\n', 'hide it not doing its office.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but this was\\n', 'all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\\n', 'well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\\n', 'escaped my notice.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am\\n', 'inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such\\n', 'an exhibition.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly not.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\\n', 'above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by\\n', 'it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\\n', 'a most country-town indifference to decorum.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\n', 'Bingley.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \"that\\n', 'this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\" A\\n', 'short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\n', '\\n', '\"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very\\n', 'sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with\\n', 'such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is\\n', 'no chance of it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\n', 'Meryton.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\\n', '\\n', '\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it\\n', 'would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\\n', 'consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\n', '\\n', 'To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\\n', 'hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\\n', \"their dear friend's vulgar relations.\\n\", '\\n', 'With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on\\n', 'leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\\n', 'She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\\n', 'late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and\\n', 'when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\\n', 'downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\\n', 'party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\\n', 'them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\\n', 'excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\\n', 'below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n', '\\n', '\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\\n', 'reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am\\n', '_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\\n', 'I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the\\n', 'table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\\n', 'others--all that his library afforded.\\n', '\\n', '\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\n', 'credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\\n', 'than I ever looked into.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\\n', 'in the room.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left\\n', 'so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\\n', 'Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\n', 'generations.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\\n', 'books.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\\n', 'these.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\n', 'that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\\n', 'half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wish it may.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\n', 'neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\\n', 'finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\n', 'Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very\\n', 'little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew\\n', 'near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his\\n', 'eldest sister, to observe the game.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will\\n', 'she be as tall as I am?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s height, or\\n', 'rather taller.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\\n', 'so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished\\n', 'for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\\n', 'to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\\n', 'net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure\\n', 'I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\\n', 'informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\\n', 'too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\n', 'otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very\\n', 'far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\\n', 'cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my\\n', 'acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\n', '\\n', '\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your\\n', 'idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\n', 'esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\n', 'with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\n', 'dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides\\n', 'all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\n', 'walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\n', 'will be but half-deserved.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must\\n', 'yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\\n', 'extensive reading.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\\n', 'I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\\n', 'this?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and\\n', 'application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\n', 'implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\n', 'answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\n', 'bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\\n', 'conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\\n', 'room.\\n', '\\n', '\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,\\n', '\"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the\\n', 'other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\\n', 'succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\\n', '\"there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\\n', 'to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\\n', 'despicable.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\n', 'continue the subject.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\\n', 'that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for\\n', 'immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\\n', 'be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\\n', 'eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\\n', \"unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\\n\", 'that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\\n', 'were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\n', 'declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\n', 'however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief\\n', 'to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\\n', 'attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 9\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the\\n\", 'morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\\n', 'inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\\n', 'and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\\n', 'sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\\n', 'note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\\n', 'own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and\\n', 'its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\\n', 'two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\n', '\\n', 'Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\\n', 'very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\\n', 'not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\\n', 'restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\\n', \"would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried\\n\", 'home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\\n', 'it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\n', \"Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\\n\", 'attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\\n', 'that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill to be\\n', 'moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\\n', 'a little longer on your kindness.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\\n', 'sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\\n', '\"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she\\n', 'remains with us.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not\\n', 'know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers\\n', 'a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\\n', 'always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\\n', 'temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are\\n', 'nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a\\n', 'charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the\\n', 'country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it\\n', 'in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\n', 'should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\\n', 'minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning towards her.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\\n', 'through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\n', 'character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in\\n', 'the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a\\n', 'studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\\n', 'least that advantage.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few subjects for\\n', 'such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\\n', 'unvarying society.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\\n', 'observed in them for ever.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning\\n', 'a country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\\n', 'going on in the country as in town.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\\n', 'turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\\n', 'victory over him, continued her triumph.\\n', '\\n', '\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\\n', 'my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\\n', 'pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\\n', 'and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\\n', 'advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\n', 'gentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing\\n', 'at all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her\\n', 'mother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\\n', 'such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,\\n', 'which you must acknowledge to be true.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting\\n', 'with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\\n', 'neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\\n', 'countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards\\n', 'Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\\n', \"saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if\\n\", 'Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\\n', 'William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So\\n', 'genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\\n', 'is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\\n', 'important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\\n', 'my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;\\n', '_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to\\n', 'judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,\\n', 'I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think\\n', 'Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\\n', \"has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast\\n\", 'of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\\n', 'better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\\n', 'partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother\\n', \"Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was\\n\", 'sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he\\n', 'did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses\\n', 'on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has\\n', 'been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\\n', 'discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\" said Darcy.\\n', '\\n', '\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\\n', 'strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\\n', 'am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\\n', 'tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\\n', 'speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\\n', 'Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\\n', 'unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\\n', 'civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\\n', 'indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\n', 'soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\\n', 'her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\\n', 'each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\\n', 'youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\\n', 'into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\n', '\\n', 'Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\\n', 'and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\\n', 'affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\\n', 'animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\\n', \"attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own\\n\", 'easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\\n', 'equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\n', 'abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\\n', 'shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\\n', \"sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:\\n\", '\\n', '\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\\n', 'your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\\n', 'the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Lydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to\\n', 'wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\\n', 'would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\" she\\n', 'added, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\\n', 'Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\\n', \"instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the\\n\", 'remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\\n', 'could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\\n', \"all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 10\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\n', 'Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\\n', 'continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined\\n', 'their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.\\n', 'Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\\n', 'the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by\\n', 'messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\\n', 'Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\n', 'attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\\n', 'commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness\\n', 'of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\\n', 'with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\\n', 'exactly in union with her opinion of each.\\n', '\\n', '\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\n', '\\n', 'He made no answer.\\n', '\\n', '\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You are mistaken.

At\\n', 'present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\\n', 'always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me\\n', 'to determine.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\\n', 'ease, cannot write ill.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried her\\n', 'brother, \"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for\\n', 'words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way\\n', 'imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which\\n', 'means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\n', 'humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\\n', 'indirect boast.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\n', 'writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\\n', 'thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\\n', 'think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\\n', 'quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any\\n', 'attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield\\n', 'you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\\n', 'panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\\n', 'laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\n', 'undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the\\n', 'foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,\\n', 'I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\\n', 'moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\\n', 'precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\n', 'you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\\n', 'dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\\n', \"mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better\\n\", \"stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not\\n\", 'go--and at another word, might stay a month.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did\\n', 'not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\\n', 'more than he did himself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\\n', 'friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\\n', 'afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\\n', 'intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a\\n', 'circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\\n', 'could.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions\\n', 'as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for\\n', 'himself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\\n', 'but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\\n', 'stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\\n', 'that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\\n', 'the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\\n', 'one argument in favour of its propriety.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\\n', 'with you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\\n', 'either.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\\n', 'friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\\n', 'one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\\n', 'one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\\n', 'supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\\n', 'circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\n', 'thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\\n', 'where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\\n', 'very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\\n', 'with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\n', 'arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\\n', 'appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\\n', 'between the parties?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\n', 'forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\\n', 'weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\\n', 'you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\\n', 'myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\\n', 'know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\\n', 'particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\\n', 'when he has nothing to do.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\\n', 'rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\\n', 'resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\\n', 'brother for talking such nonsense.\\n', '\\n', '\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend. \"You dislike an argument,\\n', 'and want to silence this.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\\n', 'Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\\n', 'thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\\n', 'Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\n', '\\n', 'When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\\n', 'for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity\\n', 'to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead\\n', 'the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\\n', 'seated herself.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,\\n', 'Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\\n', \"that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed\\n\", 'on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\\n', 'admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her\\n', 'because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,\\n', 'however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something\\n', 'more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\\n', 'any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\\n', 'him too little to care for his approbation.\\n', '\\n', 'After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by\\n', 'a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\\n', 'Elizabeth, said to her:\\n', '\\n', '\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\\n', 'opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\n', '\\n', 'She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\\n', 'surprise at her silence.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\n', \"determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'\\n\", 'that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\\n', 'delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\\n', 'their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\\n', 'you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\\n', 'you dare.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\\n', 'gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\\n', 'manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy\\n', 'had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\\n', 'believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\\n', 'should be in some danger.\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great\\n', 'anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\\n', 'assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', 'She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\\n', 'their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\n', '\\n', '\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery\\n', 'the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\\n', 'desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\\n', 'and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\\n', 'officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\\n', 'check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\\n', 'which your lady possesses.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed\\n', 'in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\\n', 'judge.

As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for\\n\", 'what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\n', 'colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\\n', 'copied.\"\\n', '\\n', 'At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\\n', 'Elizabeth herself.\\n', '\\n', '\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley, in some\\n', 'confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n', '\\n', '\"You used us abominably ill,\" answered Mrs. Hurst, \"running away without\\n', 'telling us that you were coming out.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\\n', 'by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\\n', 'and immediately said:\\n', '\\n', '\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\\n', 'avenue.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\\n', 'laughingly answered:\\n', '\\n', '\"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear\\n', 'to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\\n', 'fourth. Good-bye.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\\n', 'being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\\n', 'as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 11\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\n', 'sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the\\n', 'drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\\n', 'professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\\n', 'as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.\\n', 'Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an\\n', 'entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh\\n', 'at their acquaintance with spirit.\\n', '\\n', 'But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\\n', \"Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had\\n\", 'something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\\n', 'himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also\\n', 'made her a slight bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness\\n', \"and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and\\n\", 'attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\\n', 'should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire\\n', 'to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from\\n', 'the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\n', 'else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\\n', 'delight.\\n', '\\n', 'When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\n', 'card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\\n', 'Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\\n', 'petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and\\n', 'the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\\n', 'Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\\n', 'sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\\n', 'and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets\\n', \"and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss\\n\", 'Bennet.\\n', '\\n', \"Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\\n\", \"Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she\\n\", 'was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\\n', 'could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\\n', 'question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\\n', 'amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\\n', 'second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant\\n', 'it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\\n', 'enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\n', 'book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\\n', 'an excellent library.\"\\n', '\\n', 'No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\\n', 'cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing\\n', 'her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\\n', 'towards him and said:\\n', '\\n', '\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\\n', 'Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\\n', 'the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are\\n', 'not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\\n', 'pleasure.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\\n', 'chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\n', 'thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send\\n', 'round my cards.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\n', 'carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\\n', 'tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\\n', 'more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of\\n', 'the day.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\\n', 'near so much like a ball.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked\\n', 'about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but\\n', 'Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In\\n', 'the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,\\n', 'turning to Elizabeth, said:\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\\n', 'turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\\n', 'long in one attitude.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\\n', 'succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked\\n', 'up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\\n', 'Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\\n', 'directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\\n', 'he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\\n', 'the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\\n', 'interfere. \"What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\n', 'meaning?\"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\\n', '\\n', '\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe\\n', 'on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing\\n', 'about it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\\n', 'anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his\\n', 'two motives.\\n', '\\n', '\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon\\n', 'as she allowed him to speak. \"You either choose this method of passing\\n', \"the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret\\n\", 'affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\\n', 'appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be\\n', 'completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better\\n', 'as I sit by the fire.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard anything so\\n', 'abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth. \"We\\n', 'can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\\n', 'as you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has\\n', 'not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of\\n', 'mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will\\n', 'not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a\\n', 'subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That is an\\n', 'uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\\n', 'be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a\\n', 'laugh.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\n', 'The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their\\n', 'actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in\\n', 'life is a joke.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth--\"there are such people, but I hope I\\n', 'am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.\\n', 'Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,\\n', 'and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely\\n', 'what you are without.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study\\n', 'of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\\n', 'understanding to ridicule.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\\n', 'superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n', '\\n', '\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss Bingley;\\n', '\"and pray what is the result?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\\n', 'himself without disguise.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\\n', 'but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\\n', 'for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the\\n', 'convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others\\n', 'so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings\\n', 'are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\\n', 'would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost\\n', 'forever.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"_That_ is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment\\n', '_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\\n', 'really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\\n', 'evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And yours,\" he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to misunderstand\\n', 'them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\n', 'conversation in which she had no share. \"Louisa, you will not mind my\\n', 'waking Mr. Hurst?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\n', \"opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for\\n\", 'it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 12\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the\\n', 'next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for\\n', 'them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\\n', 'her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\\n', \"would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive\\n\", 'them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\n', \"least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\\n\", 'Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\\n', 'before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\\n', 'and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them\\n', 'very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\\n', 'resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\\n', 'contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\\n', \"she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at\\n\", 'length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\\n', 'that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\\n', '\\n', 'The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\\n', 'said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work\\n', 'on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\\n', 'then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike\\n', 'of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\\n', '\\n', 'The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\\n', 'soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\\n', 'safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\\n', 'she felt herself to be right.\\n', '\\n', 'To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at\\n', 'Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss\\n', 'Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.\\n', 'He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\\n', 'should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope\\n', 'of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been\\n', 'suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\\n', 'in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\\n', 'ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were\\n', 'at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most\\n', 'conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\\n', '\\n', 'On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\\n', \"all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last\\n\", 'very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\\n', 'after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her\\n', 'to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\\n', 'tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\\n', 'the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.\\n', '\\n', 'They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.

I do think it is the hardest thing\\n', 'in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\\n', 'children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\\n', 'to do something or other about it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They\\n', 'had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail\\n', 'bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\\n', 'five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\\n', '\\n', '\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\n', 'nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\\n', 'But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little\\n', 'softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of\\n', 'him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\\n', 'friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did\\n', 'before him?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\\n', 'head, as you will hear.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.\\n', '\\n', '\"Dear Sir,--\\n', '\\n', '\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured\\n', 'father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the\\n', 'misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but\\n', 'for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might\\n', 'seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone\\n', \"with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.\\n\", \"Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\n\", 'received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\n', 'distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de\\n', 'Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has\\n', 'preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be\\n', 'my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\\n', 'ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which\\n', 'are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I\\n', 'feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\\n', 'all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I\\n', 'flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and\\n', 'that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate\\n', 'will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the\\n', 'offered olive-branch.

The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\\n', 'think it is well expressed.\"\\n', '\\n', 'To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any\\n', 'degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\\n', 'come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\\n', 'received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\\n', \"their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,\\n\", 'and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\\n', 'astonished her husband and daughters.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\n', 'politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\\n', 'ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in\\n', 'need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a\\n', 'tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\\n', 'stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\\n', 'before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\n', 'daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this\\n', 'instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did\\n', 'not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This\\n', 'gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.\\n', '\\n', '\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\\n', 'prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\\n', 'oddly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\n', 'must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things\\n', 'I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\\n', 'will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\\n', 'could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\\n', 'forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\\n', 'prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,\\n', 'when we are better acquainted--\"\\n', '\\n', 'He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\\n', \"other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The\\n\", 'hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\\n', \"and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's\\n\", 'heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\\n', 'own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\\n', 'he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its\\n', 'cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\n', 'assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a\\n', 'good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He\\n', 'begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\\n', 'herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a\\n', 'quarter of an hour.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 14\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\\n', 'were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\\n', 'guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\\n', 'shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\\n', \"Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for\\n\", 'his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\n', 'better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\\n', 'to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\\n', 'he protested that \"he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in\\n', 'a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\\n', 'experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\\n', 'approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\n', 'preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\\n', 'and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\\n', 'quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\\n', 'people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\\n', 'She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\\n', 'made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\n', 'neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or\\n', 'two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\\n', 'marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\\n', 'once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\\n', 'approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\\n', 'to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and\\n', 'I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\\n', 'in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\\n', 'from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\n', 'extensive property.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than\\n', 'many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\\n', 'that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\\n', 'handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks\\n', 'the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\\n', 'constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many\\n', 'accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am\\n', 'informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\\n', 'resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\\n', 'to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\\n', 'court.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\\n', 'and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the\\n', 'British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased\\n', 'with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\\n', 'offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable\\n', 'to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that\\n', 'her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\n', 'elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\\n', 'her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\\n', 'it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\\n', 'pay.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you\\n', 'that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\\n', 'whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\\n', 'moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\\n', 'sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\\n', 'compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\\n', 'give them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\\n\", 'as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\\n', 'maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\\n', 'and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\\n', 'in his pleasure.\\n', '\\n', 'By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\\n', 'to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,\\n', 'glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily\\n', 'assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything\\n', 'announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and\\n', 'begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at\\n', 'him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some\\n', \"deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the\\n\", 'volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three\\n', 'pages, she interrupted him with:\\n', '\\n', '\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\\n', 'Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\\n', 'so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\\n', 'about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\\n', 'Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\n', '\\n', '\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\\n', 'of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\\n', 'me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to\\n', 'them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\\n', 'backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\\n', 'very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.\\n', \"Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's\\n\", 'interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\\n', 'resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\\n', 'young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\\n', 'affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\\n', 'for backgammon.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 15\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\\n', 'been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part\\n', 'of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\\n', 'miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\\n', 'had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\\n', 'acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\\n', 'given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a\\n', 'good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\\n', 'retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\\n', 'prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\n', 'Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which\\n', 'he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\\n', 'mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\\n', 'clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\\n', 'pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\\n', '\\n', 'Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\\n', 'marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\\n', 'a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\\n', 'them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\\n', \"This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's\\n\", 'estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\n', 'suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\\n', 'part.\\n', '\\n', \"His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face\\n\", 'confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\\n', 'was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\\n', 'choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a\\n', \"quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\\n\", 'conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\\n', 'to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at\\n', 'Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\n', 'encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. \"As to\\n', 'her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\\n', 'not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her\\n', '_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\\n', 'to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\\n', 'done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\\n', 'next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\\n', 'two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\\n', 'the day before was now high in her good graces.\\n', '\\n', \"Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\\n\", 'except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\\n', 'at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\\n', 'and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\\n', 'him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\\n', 'one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\\n', 'Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\\n', 'doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\n', 'always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\\n', 'Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the\\n', 'house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\\n', 'was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\\n', 'walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\\n', 'than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.\\n', '\\n', 'In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\n', 'cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\\n', 'the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were\\n', 'immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and\\n', 'nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in\\n', 'a shop window, could recall them.\\n', '\\n', 'But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\\n', 'they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\\n', 'with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was\\n', 'the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came\\n', 'to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the\\n', \"stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,\\n\", 'determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under\\n', 'pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately\\n', 'had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had\\n', 'reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\\n', 'permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with\\n', 'him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a\\n', 'commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the\\n', 'young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\\n', 'His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of\\n', 'beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\\n', 'The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\\n', 'of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\n', 'unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together\\n', 'very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy\\n', 'and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the\\n', 'ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\\n', 'began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and\\n', 'Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to\\n', 'Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated\\n', 'it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes\\n', 'on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\n', 'stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\\n', 'looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\\n', 'Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,\\n', 'after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\\n', 'deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to\\n', 'imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\n', '\\n', 'In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\\n', 'passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\\n', \"Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\\n\", 'pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of\\n', \"Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the\\n\", 'invitation.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,\\n', 'from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was\\n', 'eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as\\n', 'their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing\\n', \"about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the\\n\", 'street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to\\n', 'Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility\\n', \"was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She\\n\", 'received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with\\n', 'as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\\n', 'acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,\\n', 'however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who\\n', 'introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an\\n', 'excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon\\n', 'put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,\\n', 'however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that\\n', 'Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\n', \"lieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the\\n\", 'last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.\\n', 'Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the\\n', 'occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the\\n', 'officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\\n', 'disagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses\\n', 'the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\\n', 'Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\n', 'would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips\\n', 'protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\n', 'tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.

At first there\\n', \"seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\\n\", 'determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\\n', 'she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\\n', 'and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\\n', 'Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\\n', 'at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear\\n', 'him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\n', 'told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\\n', 'even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\n', 'relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\\n', 'Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\\n', 'a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\\n', '\\n', '\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\\n', 'drop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\\n', 'understand.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one. A clear\\n', 'ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more\\n', 'capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for\\n', 'I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my\\n', 'infancy.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n', '\\n', '\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\\n', 'seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\\n', 'yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly. \"I have\\n', 'spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\\n', 'disagreeable.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\\n', 'agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\\n', 'too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_\\n', 'to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\\n', 'astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\\n', 'anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in\\n', 'the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\\n', 'Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\\n', 'him more favourably spoken of by anyone.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\n', 'interruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\\n', 'their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\\n', 'world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\\n', 'high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\n', 'ill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\\n', '\\n', '\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\\n', 'likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\\n', 'was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\\n', 'not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\\n', 'wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\\n', 'and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\\n', 'avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\\n', 'of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\\n', 'is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\\n', 'that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never\\n', 'be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by\\n', 'a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\n', 'scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\n', 'everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\\n', 'memory of his father.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\\n', 'all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\n', 'neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that\\n', 'he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very\\n', 'intelligible gallantry.\\n', '\\n', '\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\\n', '\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be\\n', 'a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\\n', 'further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\\n', 'attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.\\n', 'Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\\n', 'my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\\n', 'A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\\n', 'now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\\n', 'was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\\n', 'possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\\n', 'were speaking of just now.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\\n', 'living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\\n', 'I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\\n', 'and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\\n', 'elsewhere.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be? How could his\\n', 'will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\\n', 'give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\\n', 'intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\\n', 'conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\\n', 'to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain\\n', 'it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\\n', 'of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\\n', 'less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\n', 'anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and\\n', 'I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can\\n', 'recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort\\n', 'of men, and that he hates me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\\n', 'can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\\n', 'ever as he expressed them.\\n', '\\n', '\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive? What can\\n', 'have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\\n', 'attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\n', \"less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\\n\", 'attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\\n', 'not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\\n', 'of preference which was often given me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\n', 'him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be\\n', 'despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\n', 'descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\n', 'this.\"\\n', '\\n', 'After a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_\\n', 'remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\\n', 'his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\\n', 'must be dreadful.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I can hardly\\n', 'be just to him.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\\n', 'treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\\n', 'father!\" She could have added, \"A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\\n', 'countenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented herself\\n', 'with, \"and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,\\n', 'connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\\n', 'part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\\n', 'sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\\n', 'father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,\\n', 'appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of\\n', 'use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the\\n', 'Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\n', 'intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\\n', \"be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,\\n\", \"and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\n\", 'voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\\n', 'be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable! I wonder that the very\\n', 'pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better\\n', 'motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for\\n', 'dishonesty I must call it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It _is_ wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions may\\n', 'be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has\\n', 'connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are\\n', 'none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\\n', 'impulses even than pride.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money\\n', 'freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\\n', 'poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what\\n', 'his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,\\n', 'to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\n', 'Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\n', 'which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\\n', 'careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up\\n', 'as the most attentive and best of brothers.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\n', '\\n', 'He shook his head. \"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\\n', 'speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very\\n', 'proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\\n', 'of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\\n', 'nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\\n', \"and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her\\n\", 'home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\n', 'education.\"\\n', '\\n', 'After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\\n', 'help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\n', '\\n', '\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\\n', 'who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\\n', 'be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\\n', 'know Mr. Bingley?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not at all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\\n', 'Darcy is.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\\n', 'want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\\n', 'his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is\\n', 'a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His\\n', 'pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\\n', 'sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something\\n', 'for fortune and figure.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\\n', 'the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\\n', 'Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\\n', 'made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every\\n', 'point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,\\n', 'he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\\n', 'importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged\\n', 'that she would not make herself uneasy.\\n', '\\n', '\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\\n', 'card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I\\n', 'am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\\n', 'are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\\n', 'Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\\n', 'little matters.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\\n\", 'a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\\n', 'was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\\n', '\\n', '\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him\\n', 'a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\\n', 'notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\\n', 'were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s\\n', 'connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\n', 'yesterday.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\\n', 'believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\\n', 'Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\\n', 'affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\\n', 'self-destined for another.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\\n', 'daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\\n', 'I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\\n', 'patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have\\n', 'not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\\n', 'her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\\n', 'reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\\n', 'she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\\n', 'her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her\\n', 'nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an\\n', 'understanding of the first class.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\\n', 'they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper\\n', 'put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\\n', \"Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise\\n\", \"of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to\\n\", 'everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\\n', 'gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\\n', 'think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\\n', 'the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\n', 'as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\\n', 'talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\n', 'fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and\\n', 'Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\\n', 'at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\\n', 'that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\\n', 'before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 17\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.\\n', 'Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she\\n', 'knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\\n', \"Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the\\n\", 'veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\\n', 'possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to\\n', 'interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\\n', 'done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,\\n', 'and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\\n', 'otherwise explained.\\n', '\\n', '\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some way\\n', 'or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\\n', 'misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\\n', 'conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\\n', 'without actual blame on either side.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on\\n', 'behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\\n', 'business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\\n', 'somebody.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\n', 'opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\\n', \"it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such\\n\", 'a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\\n', 'impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\\n', 'character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\\n', 'excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on, than\\n', 'that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me\\n', 'last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it\\n', 'be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his\\n', 'looks.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\\n', 'think.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,\\n', 'if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair\\n', 'became public.\\n', '\\n', 'The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\n', 'conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had\\n', 'been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal\\n', 'invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed\\n', 'for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their\\n', 'dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly\\n', 'asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To\\n', 'the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet\\n', 'as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\\n', 'the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an\\n', 'activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if\\n', \"eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.\\n\", '\\n', 'The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\\n', 'female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\\n', 'compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered\\n', 'by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\\n', 'ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\\n', 'society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\\n', 'Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\\n', \"Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look\\n\", 'and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\\n', 'less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they\\n', 'each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\n', 'he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\\n', 'was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\\n', 'had no disinclination for it.\\n', '\\n', '\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is enough--I\\n', 'think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\\n', 'Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those\\n', 'who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\\n', 'everybody.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did\\n\", 'not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\\n', \"him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if\\n\", \"he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's\\n\", 'amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\\n', 'scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\\n', 'either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\\n', 'dance.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a ball\\n', 'of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,\\n', 'can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\\n', 'myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\\n', 'cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\\n', 'soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,\\n', 'a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\\n', 'cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\\n', 'engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\\n', 'instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help\\n', \"for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce\\n\", \"delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as\\n\", 'good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\\n', 'gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\\n', 'struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy\\n', 'of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\n', 'quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\\n', 'The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\\n', 'civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\\n', 'compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\\n', 'gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\\n', 'her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\\n', 'was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\\n', 'to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\n', 'consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and\\n', 'till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\n', '\\n', 'If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\\n', 'younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this\\n', 'time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there\\n', 'was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton\\n', 'once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very\\n', 'shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have\\n', 'found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the\\n', 'improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than\\n', 'a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\\n', 'Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 18\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\\n', 'vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\\n', 'doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty\\n', 'of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\\n', 'might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\\n', 'usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\\n', 'that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\\n', 'might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose\\n', \"the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's\\n\", \"pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though\\n\", 'this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\\n', 'pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who\\n', 'told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the\\n', 'day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,\\n', '\"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\\n', 'he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\\n', 'Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\\n', \"Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every\\n\", 'feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\\n', 'disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\\n', 'the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\\n', 'Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\\n', 'was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\\n', 'with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\\n', 'speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\\n', '\\n', 'But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\\n', 'of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\\n', 'spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\\n', 'not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition\\n', 'to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\\n', 'notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;\\n', 'they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\n', 'apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\\n', 'aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\\n', 'partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\\n', 'him was ecstasy.\\n', '\\n', 'She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\\n', 'Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\\n', 'were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\\n', 'her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took\\n', 'her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,\\n', 'without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\\n', 'immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\\n', 'mind; Charlotte tried to console her:\\n', '\\n', '\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\\n', 'a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\\n', 'evil.\"\\n', '\\n', 'When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\\n', 'hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a\\n', 'simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\\n', 'in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\\n', 'answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\\n', 'she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\\n', \"reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding\\n\", 'it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\n', 'imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\\n', 'first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\\n', 'be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\\n', 'some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\\n', 'silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\n', 'with:--\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked\\n', 'about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size\\n', 'of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\\n', 'said.\\n', '\\n', '\"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may\\n', 'observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But\\n', '_now_ we may be silent.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\\n', 'entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of\\n', '_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the\\n', 'trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\n', 'imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\n', 'similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\\n', 'taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\n', 'something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\n', 'posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\\n', 'said he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\\n', 'think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\\n', 'the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\\n', 'walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\\n', 'the temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\\n', 'been forming a new acquaintance.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\\n', 'features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\\n', 'for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\\n', 'constrained manner said, \"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\\n', 'as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of\\n', '_retaining_ them, is less certain.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\\n', 'with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\\n', 'his life.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\\n', 'that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\\n', 'through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\\n', 'Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on\\n', 'his dancing and his partner.\\n', '\\n', '\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\\n', 'superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\\n', 'first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\n', 'disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\n', 'especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\\n', 'her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then\\n', 'flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You\\n', 'will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\n', 'young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\n', \"William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\n\", 'eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\\n', 'Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\\n', 'he turned to his partner, and said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made\\n', 'me forget what we were talking of.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\n', 'interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\\n', 'We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we\\n', 'are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\n', '\\n', '\"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\n', 'feelings.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\n', 'no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\\n', 'something else.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\\n', 'with a look of doubt.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\\n', 'thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\\n', 'by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\\n', 'that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\\n', 'unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\\n', 'created_.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\n', '\\n', '\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I hope not.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\\n', 'to be secure of judging properly at first.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\\n', 'to shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And what is your success?\"\\n', '\\n', 'She shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\\n', 'accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may vary\\n', 'greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\\n', 'not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\\n', 'fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\n', 'opportunity.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.\\n', 'She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\\n', 'silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,\\n', \"for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards\\n\", 'her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\\n', 'another.\\n', '\\n', 'They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and\\n', 'with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\\n', '\\n', '\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\\n', 'Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\\n', 'questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\\n', 'his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late\\n', \"Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to\\n\", \"give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's\\n\", 'using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\\n', 'always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\n', 'Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but\\n', 'I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he\\n', 'cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother\\n', 'thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to\\n', 'the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself\\n', 'out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent\\n', 'thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\\n', \"Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,\\n\", 'considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\\n', 'Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\\n', \"than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can\\n\", 'assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\n', '\"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself. \"You are much mistaken\\n', 'if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\\n', 'nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\\n', 'Darcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\\n', 'inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\\n', 'such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\\n', 'marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\\n', 'Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\\n', 'Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\n', \"before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\\n\", '\\n', '\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\n', 'sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\\n', 'been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\\n', 'you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\n', 'satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\n', 'his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\n', 'principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\\n', 'the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\\n', 'Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\\n', \"received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,\\n\", 'Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has\\n', 'been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\n', 'satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\\n', 'them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\\n', 'him _conditionally_ only.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly;\\n', '\"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\\n', \"Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\\n\", 'since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\\n', 'the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\\n', 'both gentlemen as I did before.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\\n', 'which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\\n', 'delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\\n', \"Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\\n\", 'in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\\n', 'to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\\n', 'partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\n', 'and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\\n', 'to make a most important discovery.\\n', '\\n', '\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now\\n', 'in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\\n', 'gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\\n', 'the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady\\n', 'Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\\n', 'thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de\\n', 'Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\\n', 'in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to\\n', 'do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\\n', 'ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\\n', \"I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to\\n\", 'assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\\'nnight.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him\\n', 'that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction\\n', 'as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that\\n', 'it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\\n', 'side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\\n', 'consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her\\n', 'with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\n', 'ceased speaking, replied thus:\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in\\n', 'your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your\\n', 'understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide\\n', 'difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,\\n', 'and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that\\n', 'I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with\\n', 'the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\\n', 'behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to\\n', 'follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to\\n', 'perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to\\n', 'profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\\n', 'guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\\n', 'education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young\\n', 'lady like yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\n', 'Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose\\n', 'astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced\\n', 'his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of\\n', 'it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the\\n', 'words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\" It vexed\\n', 'her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him\\n', 'with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time\\n', 'to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,\\n', \"was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\\n\", 'abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\\n', 'end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\\n', 'Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\\n', 'reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\\n', 'me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying\\n', \"that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\\n\", 'certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\\n', 'handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\n', '\\n', 'As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\\n', 'her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\\n', 'train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\\n', 'made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\\n', 'that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\\n', 'could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of\\n', \"endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\\n\", 'she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\\n', 'venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\\n', 'supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\\n', 'placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\\n', 'that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\\n', 'openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon\\n', 'be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\\n', 'seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\\n', 'match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\n', 'three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\\n', 'then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\\n', 'Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\\n', 'she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\\n', \"daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\\n\", 'other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\\n', 'able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\\n', 'she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\\n', 'necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\\n', 'such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\\n', 'concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\\n', 'fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\\n', 'chance of it.\\n', '\\n', \"In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\\n\", 'words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\\n', 'whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\\n', 'chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\\n', 'mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\\n', '\\n', '\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\\n', 'sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\\n', 'nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you\\n', 'to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\\n', 'so doing!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\\n', 'talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\\n', 'blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\\n', 'glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\\n', 'she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\n', 'convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\\n', 'of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\n', 'steady gravity.\\n', '\\n', 'At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\\n', 'had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\\n', 'likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\\n', 'chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\\n', 'tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and\\n', 'she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\\n', 'preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\\n', 'entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\\n', 'but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\n', \"exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's\\n\", 'eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her\\n', 'progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very\\n', 'ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks\\n', 'of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to\\n', 'favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\\n', \"Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\\n\", 'weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at\\n', 'Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to\\n', 'Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs\\n', 'of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\n', 'imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\n', 'interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\\n', 'and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \"That will do\\n', 'extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other\\n', 'young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\\n', \"Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\\n\", 'her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\\n', '\\n', '\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\\n', 'should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\\n', 'air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\\n', 'compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\\n', 'to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time\\n', 'to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\\n', 'rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make\\n', 'such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\n', 'offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\\n', 'that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\n', 'and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\\n', 'as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\\n', 'that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,\\n', 'especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit\\n', 'him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\n', 'occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\\n', 'family.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had\\n', 'been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many\\n', 'smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his\\n', 'wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,\\n', 'and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably\\n', 'clever, good kind of young man.\\n', '\\n', 'To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to\\n', 'expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\\n', 'have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or\\n', 'finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\\n', 'that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\\n', 'feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\\n', 'must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\\n', 'have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,\\n', 'and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\n', 'gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\n', '\\n', 'The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\\n', 'Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though\\n', 'he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her\\n', 'power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\\n', 'somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\\n', 'He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\\n', 'that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\n', 'her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\\n', 'the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\\n', 'her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\\n', \"good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\\n\", '\\n', \"She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;\\n\", 'though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\\n', 'disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\\n', 'probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\\n', 'it.\\n', '\\n', 'The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by\\n', 'a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of\\n', 'an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\\n', 'heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\\n', 'sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\\n', 'were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\\n', 'every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\\n', 'languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\\n', 'long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\\n', 'sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\\n', 'politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\\n', 'nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\\n', 'Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\\n', 'rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\n', 'silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\\n', 'much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord,\\n', 'how tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\\n', '\\n', 'When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\\n', 'civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and\\n', 'addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he\\n', 'would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without\\n', 'the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,\\n', 'and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on\\n', 'her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next\\n', 'day for a short time.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the\\n', 'delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\\n', 'settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\\n', 'see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\\n', 'months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\\n', 'with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\\n', 'Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\\n', 'man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\\n', 'was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 19\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\\n', 'declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\\n', 'his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\\n', 'no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at\\n', 'the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\\n', 'observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On\\n', 'finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,\\n', 'soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\\n', '\\n', '\"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\\n', 'when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\\n', 'course of this morning?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy\\n', 'will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I\\n', 'want you up stairs.\" And, gathering her work together, she was hastening\\n', 'away, when Elizabeth called out:\\n', '\\n', '\"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\\n', 'me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\\n', 'going away myself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\" And upon\\n', \"Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to\\n\", 'escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.\\n', 'Collins.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's\\n\", 'consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\\n', 'over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to\\n', 'conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between\\n', 'distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as\\n', 'they were gone, Mr. Collins began.\\n', '\\n', '\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\\n', 'doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\\n', 'would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\\n', 'unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected\\n', \"mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the\\n\", 'purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\\n', 'dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\\n', 'soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of\\n', 'my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\n', 'subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for\\n', 'marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\\n', 'of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\\n', 'with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could\\n', 'not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,\\n', 'and he continued:\\n', '\\n', '\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\\n', 'every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\\n', 'of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will\\n', 'add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought\\n', 'to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\\n', 'recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\\n', 'patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\\n', 'too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\\n', 'left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\n', \"arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\\n\", 'must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose\\n', 'a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\\n', 'useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\\n', 'income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\\n', \"you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\\n\", 'way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice\\n', 'and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\n', 'advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\\n', 'anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\\n', 'acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and\\n', 'respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\n', 'intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\\n', 'were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\\n', 'can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\\n', 'being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\\n', 'father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\\n', 'myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\n', 'the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\\n', 'event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not\\n', 'be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and\\n', 'I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\\n', 'remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\n', 'violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\\n', 'shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\\n', 'aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\\n', \"in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's\\n\", 'decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\n', 'therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\\n', 'no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n', '\\n', '\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no\\n', 'answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\\n', 'the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\\n', 'your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to\\n', 'decline them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\\n', 'hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\\n', 'man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\\n', 'favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a\\n', 'third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\\n', 'said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\n', 'extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\\n', 'one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\\n', 'daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\\n', 'time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\\n', 'happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\\n', 'could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\\n', 'am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\\n', 'situation.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins\\n', 'very gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\\n', 'disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of\\n', 'seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your\\n', 'modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\\n', 'must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\\n', 'of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\\n', 'refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\\n', 'In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\\n', 'feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\\n', 'estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may\\n', 'be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she\\n', 'thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus\\n', 'addressed her:\\n', '\\n', '\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\\n', 'shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\\n', 'me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\\n', 'know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on\\n', 'the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\\n', 'encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\\n', 'female character.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\\n', 'exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\\n', 'of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\\n', 'to convince you of its being one.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\n', 'refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\\n', 'believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\\n', 'unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\\n', 'be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\\n', 'with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\\n', 'circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\n', 'consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\\n', 'means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\\n', 'portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo\\n', 'the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\\n', 'therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,\\n', 'I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\\n', 'suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\\n', 'of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\\n', 'rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\\n', 'again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\\n', 'to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\\n', 'forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\\n', 'female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking\\n', 'the truth from her heart.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\n', 'gallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\\n', 'authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\\n', 'being acceptable.\"\\n', '\\n', 'To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make\\n', 'no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if\\n', 'he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\\n', 'encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\\n', 'in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\\n', 'not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 20\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\n', 'successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\\n', 'to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open\\n', 'the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\\n', 'entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\\n', 'warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\\n', 'received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\n', 'proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\\n', 'of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\\n', 'refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\n', 'from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\n', '\\n', 'This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been\\n', 'glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\\n', 'him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\\n', 'and could not help saying so.\\n', '\\n', '\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\\n', 'brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very\\n', 'headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will\\n', '_make_ her know it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if\\n', 'she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\\n', 'altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\\n', 'naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she\\n', 'actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not\\n', 'to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\\n', 'temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is\\n', 'only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\\n', 'good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\\n', 'we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\\n', 'husband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you\\n', 'are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make\\n', 'Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you\\n', 'do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\\n', 'on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\\n', 'her communication.\\n', '\\n', '\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had\\n', 'finished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\\n', 'and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\\n', 'marrying him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\n', 'library.\\n', '\\n', '\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for\\n', 'you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\\n', 'you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\" Elizabeth replied that it was.\\n', '\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have, sir.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\\n', 'accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\\n', 'be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\\n', 'again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\\n', 'if you _do_.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,\\n', 'but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\\n', 'affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\\n', '\\n', '\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to\\n', '_insist_ upon her marrying him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request.\\n', 'First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\\n', 'present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\\n', 'library to myself as soon as may be.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\\n', 'coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane\\n', 'in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\\n', 'interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\\n', 'sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\\n', 'varied, however, her determination never did.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\\n', 'He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin\\n', 'could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\\n', 'way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\\n', \"deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\n\", '\\n', 'While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\\n', 'the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\\n', 'her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are come, for there is such\\n', 'fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\\n', 'made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,\\n', 'who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\\n', 'breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\\n', 'the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\\n', 'her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her\\n', 'family. \"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone,\\n', '\"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,\\n', 'nobody feels for my poor nerves.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as unconcerned\\n', 'as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\\n', 'she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it\\n', 'into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\\n', 'you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\\n', 'to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep\\n', 'you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\\n', 'you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\\n', 'and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\\n', 'to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\\n', 'to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\\n', 'no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\\n', 'is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\n', 'any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the\\n', 'irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of\\n', 'them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with\\n', 'an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to\\n', 'the girls, \"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold\\n', 'your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation\\n', 'together.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\\n', 'Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\\n', 'detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\\n', 'herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\\n', 'curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\\n', 'not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected\\n', 'conversation: \"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this point.\\n', 'Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\\n', 'displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation\\n', 'to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a\\n', 'young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;\\n', 'and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt\\n', 'of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;\\n', 'for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as\\n', 'when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\n', 'estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect\\n', 'to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to\\n', \"your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\\n\", 'compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my\\n', 'behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\\n', \"dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all\\n\", 'liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\\n', 'My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\\n', 'consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_\\n', 'has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 21\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and\\n\", 'Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\\n', 'attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her\\n', 'mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly\\n', 'expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,\\n', 'but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke\\n', 'to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\\n', 'himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\n', 'civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\n', 'especially to her friend.\\n', '\\n', \"The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill\\n\", 'health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\\n', 'had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\\n', 'not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\\n', 'Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.\\n', '\\n', 'After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham\\n', 'were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\\n', 'He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\\n', \"aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was\\n\", 'well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\\n', 'that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\\n', '\\n', '\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not meet\\n', 'Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\\n', 'many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\\n', 'might arise unpleasant to more than myself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full\\n', 'discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly\\n', 'bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\\n', 'them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to\\n', 'her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\\n', 'compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an\\n', 'occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\\n', '\\n', 'Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\\n', 'from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,\\n', \"hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and\\n\", \"Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw\\n\", 'her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected\\n', 'herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual\\n', 'cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety\\n', 'on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\\n', 'sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\n', 'invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,\\n', 'Jane, taking out the letter, said:\\n', '\\n', '\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good\\n', 'deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\n', 'their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You\\n', 'shall hear what she says.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\\n', 'of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\\n', 'and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a\\n', 'house. The next was in these words: \"I do not pretend to regret anything\\n', 'I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;\\n', 'but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\n', 'delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\n', 'lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved\\n', 'correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these highflown\\n', 'expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;\\n', 'and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw\\n', 'nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\\n', \"absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as\\n\", 'to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to\\n', 'regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\\n', 'able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\\n', 'hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\\n', 'forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\\n', 'intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\\n', 'satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\\n', 'them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\n', 'Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\"\\n', '\\n', '\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\\n', 'took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\\n', 'are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\\n', 'Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\\n', 'determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\\n', 'his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are\\n', 'already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my\\n', 'dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of\\n', 'that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may\\n', 'abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your\\n', 'beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the\\n', 'three of whom we shall deprive you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\\n', 'winter.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own\\n', 'master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\\n', 'particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,\\n', '_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think\\n', 'Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;\\n', 'and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into\\n', 'something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of\\n', 'her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\\n', 'mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the\\n', 'country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\n', 'unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\\n', 'frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;\\n', \"her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's\\n\", 'partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\\n', \"capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to\\n\", 'favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\\n', 'Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\\n', 'of so many?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said Jane as she\\n', 'finished it. \"Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that\\n', 'Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is\\n', \"perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she\\n\", 'suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\\n', 'put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Most willingly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\\n', 'in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him\\n', 'to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\\n', 'does not care about you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Jane shook her head.\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\\n', 'together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She\\n', 'is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\\n', 'Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\\n', 'case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\\n', 'is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\\n', 'that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble\\n', 'in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and\\n', 'I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\\n', 'my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\\n', 'tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\\n', 'degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\\n', 'Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\\n', 'of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\n', 'representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\\n', 'foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\\n', 'anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving\\n', 'herself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\\n', 'will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.\\n', 'You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\n', 'accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\\n', 'elsewhere?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon mature\\n', 'deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\\n', 'more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\\n', 'all means to refuse him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling. \"You must know that\\n', 'though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\\n', 'not hesitate.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\\n', 'your situation with much compassion.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\n', 'required. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\\n', \"contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\\n\", 'interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\\n', 'wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\\n', 'so totally independent of everyone.\\n', '\\n', 'She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\n', 'on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\\n', \"Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\\n\", 'though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\\n', 'Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\n', '\\n', 'They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\\n', \"family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\\n\", 'but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\\n', 'and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\\n', 'to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\\n', 'lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\n', 'Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the\\n', 'conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had\\n', 'been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two\\n', 'full courses.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 22\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the\\n', 'chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\\n', 'Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \"It keeps him in good\\n', 'humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to you than I can express.\"\\n', 'Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\\n', 'that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\\n', \"very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\\n\", 'had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\n', \"from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards\\n\", \"herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so\\n\", 'favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\\n', 'secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very\\n', 'soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\\n', 'character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\\n', 'morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\\n', 'himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\n', 'from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\\n', 'conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\\n', 'till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\\n', 'secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\\n', 'he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\\n', 'His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\\n', 'perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\\n', 'instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\\n', 'she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\n', '\\n', \"In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,\\n\", 'everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\\n', 'they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\\n', 'was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\\n', 'be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\\n', 'his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\\n', 'guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\\n', 'continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure\\n', 'and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\n', 'establishment were gained.\\n', '\\n', 'Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\\n', \"and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present\\n\", 'circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\\n', 'they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\\n', 'exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\\n', 'interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\\n', 'Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\n', 'opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\n', 'Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\\n', \"should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,\\n\", 'were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes\\n', 'of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\\n', \"done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's\\n\", 'dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had\\n', 'gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were\\n', 'in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible\\n', 'nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must\\n', 'be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly\\n', 'either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was\\n', 'the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,\\n', 'and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\n', 'preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at\\n', 'the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all\\n', 'the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business\\n', 'was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship\\n', 'she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,\\n', 'and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\\n', 'shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\\n', 'to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\\n', 'when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\n', 'passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\\n', 'dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\\n', 'curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\\n', 'questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\\n', 'at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\n', 'publish his prosperous love.\\n', '\\n', 'As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the\\n', 'family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved\\n', 'for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,\\n', 'said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever\\n', 'his engagements might allow him to visit them.\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\n', 'gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\n', 'you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\n', 'possible.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\\n', 'so speedy a return, immediately said:\\n', '\\n', '\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation here, my\\n', 'good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\\n', 'offending your patroness.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins, \"I am particularly obliged to you\\n', 'for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\\n', 'material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her\\n', 'displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\\n', 'again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\\n', 'and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\n', 'affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\\n', 'from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\\n', 'regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though\\n', 'my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\\n', 'take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my\\n', 'cousin Elizabeth.\"\\n', '\\n', 'With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\\n', 'surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to\\n', 'understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\\n', 'younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\\n', 'She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\\n', 'a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\\n', 'means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read\\n', 'and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\n', 'agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\\n', 'kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\\n', 'private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\\n', '\\n', \"The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\\n\", 'friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\\n', 'that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from\\n', 'possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\\n', 'consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\\n', 'she could not help crying out:\\n', '\\n', '\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\\n', 'story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\\n', 'reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\\n', 'her composure, and calmly replied:\\n', '\\n', '\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\\n', \"that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\\n\", 'because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\\n', '\\n', 'But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\\n', 'for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of\\n', 'their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\\n', 'all imaginable happiness.\\n', '\\n', '\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte. \"You must be surprised,\\n', 'very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry\\n', 'you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be\\n', 'satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never\\n', \"was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's\\n\", 'character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\\n', 'chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\\n', 'entering the marriage state.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\" and after an awkward pause,\\n', 'they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\\n', 'longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\\n', 'It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\\n', \"unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\\n\", 'of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\n', \"accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was\\n\", 'not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible\\n', 'that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\n', 'feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a\\n', 'most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself\\n', 'and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it\\n', 'was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\n', 'chosen.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 23\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\\n', 'she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention\\n', 'it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to\\n', 'announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\\n', 'and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\\n', 'houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but\\n', 'incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,\\n', 'protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\n', 'often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\n', '\\n', '\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\\n', 'that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\n', \"without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\\n\", 'him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\\n', 'truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\\n', 'most forbearing courtesy.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\\n', 'a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\\n', 'mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\\n', 'endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters\\n', 'by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\\n', 'was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\\n', 'happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\\n', 'of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\\n', 'Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\\n', 'found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\\n', 'the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\\n', 'had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be\\n', 'happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\\n', 'inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\\n', 'Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she\\n', 'herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two\\n', 'points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\\n', 'console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\\n', 'resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\\n', 'scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\\n', 'or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\\n', 'could at all forgive their daughter.\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\\n\", 'as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\\n', 'it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\\n', 'been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\\n', 'more foolish than his daughter!\\n', '\\n', 'Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\n', 'less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\\n', 'nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty\\n', 'and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\\n', 'clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\\n', 'to spread at Meryton.\\n', '\\n', 'Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort\\n', 'on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\\n', 'called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\\n', \"though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\\n\", 'enough to drive happiness away.\\n', '\\n', 'Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\\n', 'mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that\\n', 'no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\\n', 'disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\\n', 'sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\\n', 'never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,\\n', 'as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his\\n', 'return.\\n', '\\n', 'Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\\n', 'the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\\n', 'letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to\\n', 'their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\\n', \"twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging\\n\", 'his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\\n', 'rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\\n', 'of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\\n', 'merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\\n', 'to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\\n', 'he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\\n', 'he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\\n', 'place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\\n', 'argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\\n', 'the happiest of men.\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\n\", 'pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\\n', 'complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\\n', 'to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\\n', 'and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\\n', 'while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\\n', 'most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and\\n', \"they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued\\n\", 'absence.\\n', '\\n', 'Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\\n', 'day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\\n', 'report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\\n', 'Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\\n', 'falsehood.\\n', '\\n', 'Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\\n', 'his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as\\n', \"she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so\\n\", 'dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\\n', 'frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\\n', 'and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\\n', 'Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for\\n', 'the strength of his attachment.\\n', '\\n', 'As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\\n', \"painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of\\n\", 'concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\\n', 'was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,\\n', 'an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\\n', 'impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\\n', 'did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed\\n', \"all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\\n\", 'tranquillity.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\\n', 'reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\\n', 'first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\\n', 'and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\\n', 'from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\\n', 'him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\\n', 'to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\\n', 'anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,\\n', 'and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight\\n', 'of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\\n', 'regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\\n', 'them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\n', 'whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\\n', 'they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\\n', 'and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She\\n', 'complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte\\n', 'Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\\n', 'make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\\n', 'better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of\\n', 'making any answer, she went on as before.\\n', '\\n', '\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\\n', 'not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What should not you mind?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\n', 'insensibility.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\\n', \"anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own\\n\", 'daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!\\n', 'Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 24\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\\n\", 'sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\\n', \"the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had\\n\", 'time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\\n', 'the country.\\n', '\\n', 'Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest\\n', 'of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\\n', \"writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied\\n\", 'the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline\\n', 'boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\\n', 'the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\\n', \"letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an\\n\", \"inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\\n\", 'the latter with regard to new furniture.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\\n', 'heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\\n', \"for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's\\n\", \"assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no\\n\", 'credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\\n', 'had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\\n', 'could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\\n', 'of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\\n', 'of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\n', 'to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,\\n', 'been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\\n', \"whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as\\n\", 'she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,\\n', 'on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\\n', \"could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really\\n\", \"died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether\\n\", \"he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\n\", 'observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be\\n', \"materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained\\n\", 'the same, her peace equally wounded.\\n', '\\n', 'A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\\n', \"Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a\\n\", 'longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\\n', 'not help saying:\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no\\n', 'idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But\\n', 'I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\\n', 'all be as we were before.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\\n', 'nothing.\\n', '\\n', '\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you have\\n', 'no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\\n', 'acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,\\n', 'and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A\\n', 'little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\"\\n', '\\n', 'With a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately,\\n', 'that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\\n', 'has done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good. Your sweetness\\n', 'and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say\\n', 'to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\\n', 'deserve.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\\n', \"the praise on her sister's warm affection.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\\n', 'world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want\\n', 'to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not\\n', 'be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\\n', 'privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\\n', 'whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\\n', 'of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\\n', 'my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\\n', 'little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\n', 'sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the\\n', \"other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is\\n\", 'unaccountable!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\\n', 'ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference\\n', \"of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and\\n\", \"Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a\\n\", 'large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\\n', \"ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like\\n\", 'regard and esteem for our cousin.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\\n', 'could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\\n', 'Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\\n', 'understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\\n', 'conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as\\n', 'I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him\\n', 'cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\\n', 'it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\\n', 'change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\\n', 'yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\\n', 'danger security for happiness.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\" replied\\n', 'Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy\\n', 'together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\\n', 'mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\\n', 'you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\\n', 'saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\\n', 'ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\\n', 'to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\\n', 'our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\\n', 'it does.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And men take care that they should.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\\n', 'of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to design,\"\\n', 'said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\\n', 'unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\\n', \"want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,\\n\", 'will do the business.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\\n', 'I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\\n', 'only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can\\n', 'secure it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\\n', 'happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\\n', 'may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\\n', 'connections, and pride.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\" replied Jane;\\n', '\"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\\n', 'known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\\n', 'her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\\n', \"they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think\\n\", 'herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\\n', 'objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try\\n', 'to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\\n', 'affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\\n', 'unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\\n', 'mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what\\n', 'I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in\\n', 'the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's\\n\", 'name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\\n', 'more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\\n', 'for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with\\n', 'less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she\\n', 'did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the\\n', 'effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her\\n', 'no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\\n', \"the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best\\n\", 'comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \"So, Lizzy,\" said he one day,\\n', '\"your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to\\n', 'being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.\\n', 'It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction\\n', 'among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\\n', 'be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in\\n', 'Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.

They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\\n', 'added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\\n', 'heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\\n', 'was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\\n', 'pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\\n', 'had known anything of the matter.\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be\\n', 'any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society\\n', 'of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\\n', 'allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else\\n', 'Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 25\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\\n', 'Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\\n', 'Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\\n', 'side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason\\n', 'to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would\\n', 'be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his\\n', 'relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair\\n', 'cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another\\n', 'letter of thanks.\\n', '\\n', 'On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving\\n', 'her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas\\n', 'at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\\n', 'superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\\n', 'ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived\\n', 'by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\\n', 'well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\\n', 'than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\\n', 'woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the\\n', 'two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.\\n', 'They had frequently been staying with her in town.\\n', '\\n', \"The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to\\n\", 'distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\\n', 'done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\\n', 'had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\\n', 'girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was\\n', 'nothing in it.\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got Mr.\\n', 'Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think\\n', \"that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not\\n\", 'been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\\n', 'and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\\n', 'a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just\\n', 'as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,\\n', 'sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\\n', 'them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\\n', 'so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\\n', 'before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\\n', 'greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of\\n', 'long sleeves.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,\\n', \"in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her\\n\", 'sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\\n', 'conversation.\\n', '\\n', 'When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \"It\\n', 'seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\" said she. \"I am\\n', 'sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such\\n', 'as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl\\n', 'for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets\\n', 'her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will not\\n', 'do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often\\n', 'happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\\n', 'independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\\n', 'love with only a few days before.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so\\n', 'doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\\n', \"often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,\\n\", \"as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's\\n\", 'love?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\n', 'inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\\n', 'they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\\n', 'offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I\\n', 'spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be\\n', 'finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\\n', 'Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\\n', 'over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\\n', 'would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she\\n', 'would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be\\n', 'of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\\n', 'anything.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\\n', \"of her sister's ready acquiescence.\\n\", '\\n', '\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with regard to\\n', 'this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\\n', 'town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\\n', 'out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,\\n', 'unless he really comes to see her.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\\n', 'friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such\\n', 'a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may\\n', 'perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\\n', \"would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\\n\", 'impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\\n', 'never stirs without him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\\n', 'correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\\n', \"point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being\\n\", 'withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\\n', 'convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\\n', 'hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\\n', 'his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends\\n', \"successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's\\n\", 'attractions.\\n', '\\n', \"Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the\\n\", 'Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she\\n', \"hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,\\n\", 'she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\\n', 'seeing him.\\n', '\\n', 'The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,\\n', 'the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\\n', 'engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\\n', 'of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\\n', 'dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\\n', 'made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\\n', \"on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's\\n\", 'warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,\\n', 'from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\\n', 'of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and\\n', 'she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\\n', 'Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\\n', 'an attachment.\\n', '\\n', 'To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\\n', 'unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\\n', 'before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very\\n', 'part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\\n', 'acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since\\n', \"the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\\n\", 'intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\\n', 'procuring.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\\n', 'character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject\\n', 'of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute\\n', 'description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of\\n', 'praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both\\n', \"him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's\\n\", \"treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's\\n\", 'reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and\\n', 'was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam\\n', 'Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 26\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given\\n\", 'on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after\\n', 'honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:\\n', '\\n', '\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\\n', 'you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\\n', 'openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\\n', 'yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want\\n', 'of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\\n', '_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\\n', 'ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you\\n', 'must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\\n', 'expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\\n', 'good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\\n', 'myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\\n', 'can prevent it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with\\n', 'Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\\n', 'the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\\n', 'me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\\n', \"of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does\\n\", 'me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\\n', 'father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\\n', 'should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\\n', 'since we see every day that where there is affection, young people\\n', 'are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into\\n', 'engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\\n', 'of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it\\n', 'would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\\n', 'to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\\n', 'object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,\\n', 'I will do my best.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\\n', 'often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: \"very\\n', 'true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\\n', 'that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\\n', \"so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the\\n\", 'necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\\n', 'honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope\\n', 'you are satisfied.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for\\n', 'the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice\\n', 'being given on such a point, without being resented.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\\n', 'by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,\\n', 'his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was\\n', 'now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think\\n', 'it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that\\n', 'she \"_wished_ they might be happy.\" Thursday was to be the wedding day,\\n', 'and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\\n', \"rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and\\n\", 'reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her\\n', 'out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:\\n', '\\n', '\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"_That_ you certainly shall.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to\\n', 'come to Hunsford.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\\n', 'visit.\\n', '\\n', '\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added Charlotte, \"and I\\n', 'hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as\\n', 'welcome as either of them.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from\\n', 'the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on\\n', 'the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their\\n', 'correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that\\n', 'it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\\n', 'address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,\\n', 'and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\\n', \"sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters\\n\", 'were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\n', 'curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\\n', 'like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\\n', 'be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\\n', 'expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\\n', 'wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\\n', 'which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\n', \"roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most\\n\", \"friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and\\n\", 'Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\\n', 'for her own visit there to know the rest.\\n', '\\n', 'Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their\\n', 'safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\\n', 'would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\n', '\\n', 'Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\\n', 'generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or\\n', 'hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\\n', 'her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\\n', 'lost.\\n', '\\n', '\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of the\\n', 'town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\\n', '\"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words, \"but she was very\\n', 'glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\\n', 'to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached\\n', 'her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\\n', 'engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\\n', 'Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was\\n', 'not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\\n', 'see them soon here.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\\n', \"accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.\\n\", '\\n', 'Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\\n', 'persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\\n', \"blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning\\n\", 'for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\\n', 'visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\\n', 'the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\\n', 'longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\\n', 'prove what she felt.\\n', '\\n', '\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her\\n', 'better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been\\n', \"entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,\\n\", 'though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I\\n', 'still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was\\n', 'as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for\\n', 'wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to\\n', 'happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not\\n', 'return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I\\n', 'receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that\\n', 'she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\n', 'calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was\\n', 'in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was\\n', 'perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,\\n', 'though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out\\n', 'as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on\\n', 'her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting\\n', 'wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the\\n', 'cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know\\n', 'this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily\\n', 'account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to\\n', 'his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\\n', 'amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,\\n', 'because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.\\n', 'He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said\\n', 'herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she\\n', 'wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I\\n', 'cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\\n', 'be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity\\n', 'in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,\\n', 'and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the\\n', 'invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\\n', 'soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield\\n', 'again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better\\n', 'not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts\\n', 'from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\\n', 'Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she\\n', 'considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\\n', 'All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\\n', 'even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on\\n', 'every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\\n', 'advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\\n', \"Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly\\n\", 'regret what he had thrown away.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\n', 'concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth\\n', 'had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\\n', 'herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\\n', 'he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\\n', 'see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\\n', 'Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\\n', 'with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\\n', 'permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\\n', 'remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\\n', 'agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\\n', \"in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\\n\", 'Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to\\n', 'suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\\n', 'ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\\n', 'sincerely wish him happy.\\n', '\\n', 'All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the\\n', 'circumstances, she thus went on: \"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that\\n', 'I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure\\n', 'and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and\\n', 'wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\\n', 'towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\\n', 'out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to\\n', 'think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\\n', 'watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\n', 'interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love\\n', 'with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\\n', 'Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\\n', 'his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the\\n', 'ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\\n', 'handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 27\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise\\n', 'diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\\n', 'sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\\n', 'Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\\n', 'going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan\\n', 'and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\\n', 'as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing\\n', 'Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There\\n', 'was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\n', 'uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\\n', 'was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her\\n', 'a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\\n', 'been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\\n', \"and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was\\n\", 'to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement\\n', 'of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became\\n', 'perfect as plan could be.\\n', '\\n', 'The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\\n', 'and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\\n', 'told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\\n', '\\n', 'The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\\n', 'his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\\n', 'Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\\n', 'first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\\n', 'of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of\\n', 'what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\\n', 'opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\\n', 'was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to\\n', 'him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,\\n', 'whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\\n', 'and pleasing.\\n', '\\n', 'Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\n', 'think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\\n', 'good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\\n', 'that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\\n', 'delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\\n', \"she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of\\n\", 'the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\\n', 'worn out, like his information.\\n', '\\n', 'It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\\n', \"as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's\\n\", 'door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\\n', 'they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\\n', 'looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\\n', 'lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\\n', \"whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to\\n\", 'wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen\\n', 'her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\\n', 'kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\\n', 'shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her\\n', 'sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\\n', 'her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\\n', 'spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,\\n', 'to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\\n', \"particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and\\n\", 'repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\\n', 'herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\n', 'acquaintance.\\n', '\\n', \"Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and\\n\", 'complimented her on bearing it so well.\\n', '\\n', '\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss King? I\\n', 'should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\\n', 'between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\\n', 'and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\\n', 'because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get\\n', 'a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\\n', 'mercenary.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\\n', 'what to think.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\\'s death\\n', 'made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\\n', 'affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\\n', 'making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\\n', 'poor?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her\\n', 'so soon after this event.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\\n', 'decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\\n', 'why should _we_?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\\n', 'deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\\n', 'mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\\n', 'to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\\n', 'Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\\n', 'much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow\\n', 'where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\\n', 'neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\\n', 'worth knowing, after all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\\n', 'unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\\n', 'a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\\n', '\\n', '\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\\n', '\"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\n', '\\n', 'No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\\n', 'acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \"Oh, my dear,\\n', 'dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight! what felicity! You\\n', 'give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What\\n', 'are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport\\n', 'we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other\\n', 'travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We\\n', '_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.\\n', 'Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our\\n', 'imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,\\n', 'will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_\\n', 'first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of\\n', 'travellers.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 28\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to\\n\", 'Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\\n', 'seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\\n', 'and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\\n', '\\n', 'When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\\n', 'search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\\n', 'The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\\n', 'smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\\n', '\\n', 'At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\\n', 'road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,\\n', 'everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\\n', 'appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which\\n', 'led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\\n', 'the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\\n', 'at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\\n', 'liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\\n', 'coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\\n', \"instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;\\n\", 'his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\n', 'minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\\n', 'family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\\n', 'neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they\\n', 'were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\\n', \"formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's\\n\", 'offers of refreshment.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\\n', 'in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its\\n', 'aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,\\n', 'as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But\\n', 'though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to\\n', 'gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at\\n', 'her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.\\n', 'When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\n', 'ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her\\n', 'eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but\\n', 'in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to\\n', 'admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to\\n', 'the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\\n', 'happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\\n', 'garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\\n', 'which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\\n', 'respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\\n', 'with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\\n', 'owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\\n', 'through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\\n', 'interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\\n', 'with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\\n', 'fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\\n', 'the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\\n', 'the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the\\n', 'prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered\\n', 'the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome\\n', 'modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\n', '\\n', 'From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\\n', 'but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\\n', 'frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\\n', 'took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\\n', \"probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's\\n\", 'help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\\n', 'was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which\\n', 'Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\\n', 'forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\\n', \"Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\\n\", 'forgotten.\\n', '\\n', 'She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\\n', 'was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\\n', 'in, observed:\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\\n', 'de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\\n', 'be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\\n', 'doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice\\n', 'when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she\\n', 'will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\\n', 'honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\\n', 'charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed\\n', \"to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\\n\", '_should_ say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has several.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\" added\\n', 'Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\\n', 'woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\\n', 'and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,\\n', 'Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\\n', \"Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\\n\", 'and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\\n', 'was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit\\n', 'would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\\n', 'interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\\n', 'Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\\n', '\\n', 'About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\\n', 'for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\\n', 'confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\\n', 'up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\\n', 'the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with\\n', 'agitation, cried out--\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\\n', 'there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\\n', 'haste, and come down this moment.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\\n', 'and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in\\n', 'quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\\n', 'garden gate.\\n', '\\n', '\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth. \"I expected at least that the pigs\\n', 'were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\\n', 'daughter.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is not\\n', 'Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;\\n', 'the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\\n', 'creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\\n', 'Why does she not come in?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\\n', 'when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \"She\\n', 'looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\\n', 'make him a very proper wife.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\\n', \"with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was\\n\", 'stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\\n', 'before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that\\n', 'way.\\n', '\\n', 'At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\\n', 'the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\\n', 'girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\\n', 'Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\\n', 'to dine at Rosings the next day.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 29\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\\n\", 'The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\\n', 'visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\\n', 'wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity\\n', 'of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\\n', \"Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\\n\", '\\n', '\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised by\\n', \"her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at\\n\", 'Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it\\n', 'would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who\\n', 'could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there\\n', '(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately\\n', 'after your arrival!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir William,\\n', '\"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\\n', 'my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\\n', 'instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\\n', 'visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\\n', 'they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\\n', 'so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\\n', '\\n', 'When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--\\n', '\\n', '\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\\n', 'Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\\n', 'becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\\n', 'whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\\n', 'for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you\\n', 'for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\\n', 'preserved.\"\\n', '\\n', 'While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\\n', 'doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\\n', 'objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\\n', 'her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas\\n', 'who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\\n', 'introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\\n', \"to his presentation at St. James's.\\n\", '\\n', 'As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\n', 'mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\\n', 'Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\\n', 'raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\\n', 'slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\\n', 'house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\\n', 'cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\n', '\\n', \"When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every\\n\", 'moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\\n', \"Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\\n\", 'Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\\n', 'miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought\\n', 'she could witness without trepidation.\\n', '\\n', 'From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\n', 'rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they\\n', 'followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady\\n', 'Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,\\n', 'with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\\n', 'settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should\\n', 'be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those\\n', 'apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\\n', '\\n', \"In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely\\n\", 'awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\\n', 'enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\\n', 'and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\\n', 'of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\\n', 'quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\\n', 'composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\n', 'features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\\n', 'conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\\n', 'visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\\n', 'silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,\\n', 'as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\\n', \"Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she\\n\", 'believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.\\n', '\\n', 'When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\\n', 'she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\\n', \"daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her\\n\", 'being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\\n', 'likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\\n', 'features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\\n', 'little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\\n', 'there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\\n', 'to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\n', 'her eyes.\\n', '\\n', 'After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\\n', 'admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\\n', 'and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\\n', 'looking at in the summer.\\n', '\\n', 'The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and\\n', 'all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had\\n', 'likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her\\n', \"ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\\n\", 'nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\\n', 'alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir\\n', 'William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\\n', 'said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\n', 'But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\\n', 'gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\\n', 'a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\\n', 'was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\\n', 'between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\\n', 'listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\\n', 'dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\\n', 'Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\\n', 'she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\\n', 'gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\n', '\\n', 'When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\\n', 'be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\\n', 'intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\\n', 'subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to\\n', \"have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic\\n\", 'concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as\\n', 'to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\\n', 'regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\\n', 'care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\\n', \"beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an\\n\", 'occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse\\n', 'with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\\n', 'Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\\n', 'the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,\\n', 'pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters\\n', 'she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\\n', 'them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\\n', 'had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been\\n', \"her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of\\n\", 'her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\\n', 'observed,\\n', '\\n', '\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your\\n', 'sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\\n', 'occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\\n', \"necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss\\n\", 'Bennet?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"A little.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\\n', 'instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it\\n', 'some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"One of them does.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\\n', 'Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\\n', 'you draw?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, not at all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What, none of you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not one.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\\n', 'should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Has your governess left you?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We never had any governess.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\\n', 'without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\\n', 'have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been\\n', 'the case.\\n', '\\n', '\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you\\n', 'must have been neglected.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\\n', 'wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\\n', 'read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\\n', 'idle, certainly might.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had\\n', 'known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\\n', 'one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\\n', 'and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\\n', 'wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\\n', 'way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\\n', 'of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\\n', 'it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,\\n', 'who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\\n', \"delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's\\n\", \"calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady\\n\", \"Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your\\n\", 'younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, ma\\'am, all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\\n', 'younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters\\n', 'must be very young?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be\\n', \"much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon\\n\", 'younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\\n', 'amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\\n', 'marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\\n', 'as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\\n', 'not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very decidedly\\n', 'for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth, smiling, \"your\\n', 'ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\\n', 'and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\\n', 'dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\n', '\\n', '\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not\\n', 'conceal your age.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\n', '\\n', 'When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables\\n', 'were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\\n', 'down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\\n', 'two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\\n', 'party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\\n', 'uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\\n', \"expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or\\n\", 'having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\\n', 'other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\\n', 'of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\\n', 'was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her\\n', 'for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\\n', 'Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\\n', 'and noble names.\\n', '\\n', 'When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\\n', 'the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\\n', 'gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\\n', 'round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\\n', 'to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by\\n', 'the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\n', \"Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon\\n\", 'as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin\\n', 'to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for\\n', \"Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her\\n\", 'commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy\\n', \"Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise\\n\", 'into his own hands.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 30\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long\\n', \"enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,\\n\", 'and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\\n', 'often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\\n', 'morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but\\n', 'when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\\n', 'and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\n', 'cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast\\n', 'and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in\\n', 'reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,\\n', 'which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\\n', 'Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\\n', 'the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\\n', 'more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\\n', 'reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\\n', 'much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and\\n', 'she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\n', '\\n', 'From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\\n', 'were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\\n', 'along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\\n', 'which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\\n', 'almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and\\n', \"had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\n\", 'prevailed upon to get out.\\n', '\\n', 'Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\\n', 'not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\\n', 'and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\\n', 'to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\\n', 'hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,\\n', 'and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\n', 'these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\\n', 'and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\\n', 'of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\\n', 'accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\\n', \"out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.\\n\", '\\n', 'Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\n', 'commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate\\n', 'in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her\\n', 'by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to\\n', 'be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\\n', 'village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\\n', 'them into harmony and plenty.\\n', '\\n', 'The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\\n', 'and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\\n', 'card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\\n', 'of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\\n', \"in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,\\n\", 'however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\\n', 'comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with\\n', 'Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\\n', 'often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\\n', 'frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\\n', 'along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\\n', 'a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\\n', \"where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.\\n\", '\\n', 'In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\\n', 'Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\\n', 'addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\\n', 'important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was\\n', 'expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not\\n', 'many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\\n', 'furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\\n', \"she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\\n\", 'were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently\\n', 'destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\\n', 'satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\\n', 'seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\\n', 'Miss Lucas and herself.\\n', '\\n', 'His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\\n', 'the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\\n', 'in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his\\n', 'bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\\n', 'intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\\n', 'respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\\n', 'Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of\\n', 'his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\\n', 'Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen\\n', \"them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running\\n\", 'into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\\n', '\\n', '\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\\n', 'never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\\n', 'before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\\n', 'afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\\n', 'who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\\n', 'address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\\n', 'used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\\n', 'reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\n', 'friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\\n', 'curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\n', '\\n', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\n', 'readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\\n', 'his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\\n', 'garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\\n', 'At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\\n', 'Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\\n', \"way, and after a moment's pause, added:\\n\", '\\n', '\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\\n', 'happened to see her there?\"\\n', '\\n', 'She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\\n', 'whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between\\n', 'the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he\\n', 'answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\\n', 'subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\\n', 'away.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 31\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\\n\", 'and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures\\n', 'of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\\n', 'received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the\\n', 'house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\\n', \"almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by\\n\", 'such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\n', 'come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\\n', 'of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the\\n', 'Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen\\n', 'only at church.\\n', '\\n', 'The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined\\n', \"the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received\\n\", 'them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\\n', 'acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\\n', 'almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\\n', 'much more than to any other person in the room.\\n', '\\n', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a\\n', \"welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had\\n\", 'moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\\n', 'talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\\n', 'at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\\n', 'well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\\n', 'spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,\\n', 'as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\n', 'towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a\\n', 'while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\\n', 'scruple to call out:\\n', '\\n', '\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\\n', 'of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer able to avoid\\n', 'a reply.\\n', '\\n', '\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\\n', 'must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.\\n', 'There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment\\n', 'of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,\\n', 'I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\\n', 'had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed\\n', 'delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.\\n\", '\\n', '\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\\n', 'Catherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel\\n', 'if she does not practice a good deal.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such advice.\\n', 'She practises very constantly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\\n', 'to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\\n', 'tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\\n', 'constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she\\n', 'will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\\n', 'Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\\n', 'her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\n', \"Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part\\n\", 'of the house.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made\\n\", 'no answer.\\n', '\\n', 'When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\\n', 'promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\\n', 'drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\\n', 'talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away\\n', 'from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte\\n', \"stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's\\n\", 'countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\\n', 'convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\n', '\\n', '\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\\n', 'me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There\\n', 'is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the\\n', 'will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate\\n', 'me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you could not\\n', 'really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have\\n', 'had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find\\n', 'great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are\\n', 'not your own.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\n', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\\n', 'me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\\n', 'in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part\\n', 'of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of\\n', 'credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all\\n', 'that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to\\n', 'say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\\n', 'things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\n', '\\n', '\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried Colonel\\n', 'Fitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\\n', 'The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\\n', 'was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced\\n', 'only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain\\n', 'knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a\\n', 'partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\\n', 'beyond my own party.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\\n', 'Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I sought an\\n', 'introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth, still\\n', 'addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\\n', 'education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend\\n', 'himself to strangers?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to\\n', 'him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said Darcy,\\n', '\"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\\n', 'catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\\n', 'concerns, as I often see done.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the\\n', \"masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same\\n\", 'force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\\n', 'have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the\\n', 'trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as\\n', 'capable as any other woman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Darcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have employed your\\n', 'time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\\n', 'think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\\n', 'what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\\n', 'Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\\n', 'to Darcy:\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\\n', 'could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\\n', \"of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have\\n\", 'been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\\n', \"cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\\n\", 'discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\\n', 'de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\\n', 'been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\\n', '\\n', \"Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing\\n\", 'with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\\n', 'them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the\\n', \"gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was\\n\", 'ready to take them all home.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 32\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane\\n', 'while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\\n', 'when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\\n', 'visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to\\n', 'be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her\\n', 'half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,\\n', 'when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and\\n', 'Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\\n', '\\n', 'He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his\\n', 'intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were\\n', 'to be within.\\n', '\\n', 'They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,\\n', 'seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\\n', 'necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence\\n', 'recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and\\n', 'feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\\n', 'departure, she observed:\\n', '\\n', '\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\\n', 'It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\\n', 'all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\\n', 'before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short\\n', 'pause added:\\n', '\\n', '\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\\n', 'returning to Netherfield again?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\\n', 'very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and\\n', 'is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\\n', 'increasing.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\\n', 'the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\\n', 'might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\\n', 'not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\\n', 'for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same\\n', 'principle.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up as\\n', 'soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\\n', 'friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\\n', 'trouble of finding a subject to him.\\n', '\\n', 'He took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable\\n', 'house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\\n', 'Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\\n', 'kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one\\n', 'of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\\n', 'him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\\n', 'I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the\\n', 'wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a\\n', 'prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\n', 'distance of her own family and friends.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day\\'s\\n', 'journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\\n', 'of the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should never have said Mrs. Collins\\n', 'was settled _near_ her family.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\\n', 'the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\"\\n', '\\n', 'As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she\\n', 'understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\\n', 'Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\\n', 'family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\\n', 'varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of\\n', 'travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\\n', 'case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\\n', 'such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\\n', 'friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\\n', 'the present distance.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"_You_ cannot\\n', 'have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\\n', 'been always at Longbourn.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\\n', 'feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and\\n', 'glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\n', '\\n', '\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\n', '\\n', 'A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\\n', 'calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\\n', 'and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised\\n', 'them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding\\n', 'on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying\\n', 'much to anybody, went away.\\n', '\\n', '\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he was\\n', 'gone. \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\\n', 'have called us in this familiar way.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\\n', \"even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various\\n\", 'conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\\n', 'the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\\n', 'from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\\n', 'was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot\\n', 'always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\\n', 'pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\\n', 'two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\\n', 'almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\n', 'separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\\n', 'aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\\n', 'had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\\n', 'him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\\n', 'being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\\n', 'former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\\n', \"there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\\n\", 'she believed he might have the best informed mind.\\n', '\\n', 'But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\\n', 'to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\\n', 'ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,\\n', 'it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice\\n', 'to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\\n', 'animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\\n', \"Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\\n\", 'generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\\n', 'her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect\\n', 'of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\\n', 'seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at\\n', 'Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\\n', 'certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\\n', 'look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\n', 'doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\\n', 'seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\n', '\\n', 'She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\\n', 'being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\\n', 'Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\\n', 'raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\\n', \"opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\\n\", 'vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\\n', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he\\n', 'certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\\n', 'to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\\n', 'in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 33\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\n', 'unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\\n', 'mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to\\n', 'prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that\\n', 'it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\\n', 'therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like\\n', 'wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was\\n', 'not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\\n', 'but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\\n', 'never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\n', 'or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\n', 'rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about\\n', 'her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\\n', \"opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of\\n\", 'Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\\n', 'expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\\n', '_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\\n', 'Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\\n', 'mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed\\n', 'her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\\n', 'pales opposite the Parsonage.\\n', '\\n', \"She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,\\n\", 'and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in\\n', 'spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw\\n', 'on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the\\n', 'letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:\\n', '\\n', '\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I generally\\n', 'do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are\\n', 'you going much farther?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\n', '\\n', 'And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\\n', 'together.\\n', '\\n', '\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\\n', 'arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\\n', 'pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\\n', 'more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\\n', '\"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it\\n', 'than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\\n', 'feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\\n', 'dependence.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\\n', 'either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\\n', 'dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\\n', 'wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\\n', 'experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\\n', 'weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where\\n', 'they like.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\\n', 'do.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many\\n', 'in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\\n', 'money.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the\\n', 'idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what\\n', \"is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is\\n\", 'very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\\n', 'a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\\n', 'she soon afterwards said:\\n', '\\n', '\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\\n', 'having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\\n', 'lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\\n', 'for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\\n', 'likes with her.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must\\n', 'divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\\n', 'charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a\\n', 'little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\\n', 'may like to have her own way.\"\\n', '\\n', 'As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\\n', 'in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\\n', 'give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\\n', 'got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:\\n', '\\n', '\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\\n', 'say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\\n', 'very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\\n', 'Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he\\n', 'is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\\n', 'Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\\n', 'those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\\n', 'our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\\n', 'him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\\n', 'Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What is it you mean?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,\\n', \"because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an\\n\", 'unpleasant thing.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\\n', 'Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\\n', 'on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\\n', 'imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\\n', 'particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing\\n', 'him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\\n', 'knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\\n', 'lady.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \"He\\n', 'only told me what I have now told you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\\n', 'indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\\n', 'was so thoughtful.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your\\n', 'cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\\n', \"friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to\\n\", 'determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.\\n', 'But,\" she continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the\\n', 'particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\\n', 'that there was much affection in the case.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\\n', 'lessening of the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\\n', 'of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and\\n', 'therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent\\n', 'matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\\n', 'as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\\n', 'of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\\n', 'people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\\n', 'could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\\n', 'such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\\n', 'taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\\n', 'always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement\\n', 'of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was\\n', 'the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had\\n', 'suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while\\n', 'every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the\\n', 'world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\n', '\\n', '\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were Colonel\\n', \"Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her\\n\", 'having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\\n', 'business in London.\\n', '\\n', '\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility of\\n', 'objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding\\n', 'excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither\\n', 'could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\\n', 'peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and\\n', 'respectability which he will probably never reach.\" When she thought of\\n', 'her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow\\n', 'that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\n', 'pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of\\n', \"importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;\\n\", 'and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed\\n', 'by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.\\n', 'Bingley for his sister.\\n', '\\n', 'The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\\n', 'headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to\\n', 'her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\\n', 'cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\\n', 'seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much\\n', 'as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\\n', \"could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather\\n\", 'displeased by her staying at home.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 34\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself\\n', 'as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\\n', 'examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\\n', 'being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\\n', 'revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\\n', 'But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\\n', 'cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,\\n', 'proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\n', 'disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\\n', 'noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\\n', \"attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's\\n\", 'shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her\\n', \"a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation\\n\", 'to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the\\n', 'next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should\\n', 'herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of\\n', 'her spirits, by all that affection could do.\\n', '\\n', \"She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that\\n\", 'his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\\n', 'that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not\\n', 'mean to be unhappy about him.\\n', '\\n', 'While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\\n', 'door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\\n', 'being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\\n', 'the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.\\n', 'But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\\n', 'affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\\n', 'room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\\n', 'health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\\n', 'She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\\n', 'then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\\n', 'said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\\n', 'in an agitated manner, and thus began:\\n', '\\n', '\"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\\n', 'repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\\n', 'you.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\\n\", 'doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;\\n', 'and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,\\n', 'immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides\\n', 'those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the\\n', 'subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\\n', 'its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always\\n', 'opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to\\n', 'the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\\n', 'suit.\\n', '\\n', 'In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\\n', \"the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\\n\", 'not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\\n', 'receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she\\n', 'lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\\n', 'answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\\n', 'representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite\\n', 'of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\n', 'expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\\n', 'his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt\\n', 'of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but\\n', 'his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could\\n', 'only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her\\n', 'cheeks, and she said:\\n', '\\n', '\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\n', 'express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\\n', 'unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should\\n', 'be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\\n', 'cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\\n', 'bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\\n', 'anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\\n', 'of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\\n', 'the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\\n', 'overcoming it after this explanation.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed\\n', 'on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\\n', 'surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance\\n', 'of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\\n', 'appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\\n', \"himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings\\n\", 'dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\\n', '\\n', '\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\\n', 'I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\\n', 'civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident a desire\\n', 'of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\\n', 'against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\\n', 'Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\\n', 'other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against\\n', 'you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you\\n', 'think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\n', 'been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\\n', 'beloved sister?\"\\n', '\\n', 'As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\\n', 'was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\\n', 'continued:\\n', '\\n', '\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\\n', 'excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\\n', 'you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means\\n', 'of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the\\n', 'world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\\n', 'disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\\n', 'kind.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\\n', 'with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\\n', 'He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\\n', '\\n', '\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\n', '\\n', 'With assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of denying\\n', 'that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\\n', 'sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\\n', 'kinder than towards myself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\\n', 'but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\\n', '\\n', '\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike\\n', 'is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was\\n', 'decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\\n', 'many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\\n', 'say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\\n', 'or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said Darcy,\\n', 'in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\n', '\\n', '\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\\n', 'interest in him?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes\\n', 'have been great indeed.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy. \"You have reduced\\n', 'him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have\\n', 'withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for\\n', 'him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence\\n', 'which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!\\n', 'and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and\\n', 'ridicule.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\\n', '\"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!\\n', 'I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\\n', 'calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\" added he, stopping in\\n', 'his walk, and turning towards her, \"these offenses might have been\\n', 'overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\\n', 'scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\\n', 'bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\n', 'policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of\\n', 'my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\\n', 'reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\\n', 'Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\\n', 'just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\\n', 'connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose\\n', 'condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\\n', 'the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\n', '\\n', '\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\\n', 'declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern\\n', 'which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more\\n', 'gentlemanlike manner.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\\n', '\\n', '\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that\\n', 'would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\\n', 'expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\\n', '\\n', '\"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of\\n', 'my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest\\n', 'belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of\\n', 'the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\\n', 'disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\\n', 'dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\\n', 'last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\\n', 'feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\\n', 'Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\\n', 'wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\n', '\\n', 'And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\\n', 'the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\\n', '\\n', 'The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\\n', 'to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for\\n', 'half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,\\n', 'was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of\\n', 'marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for\\n', 'so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of\\n', \"all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying\\n\", 'her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his\\n', 'own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired\\n', 'unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable\\n', 'pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to\\n', 'Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could\\n', 'not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.\\n', 'Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\\n', 'overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for\\n', 'a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the\\n', \"sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to\\n\", \"encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 35\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\\n', 'which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\\n', 'surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything\\n', 'else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after\\n', 'breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\\n', \"directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's\\n\", 'sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\\n', 'she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\\n', 'park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\\n', 'of the gates into the ground.\\n', '\\n', 'After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\\n', 'tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\\n', 'look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\\n', 'made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\\n', 'verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\\n', 'when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\\n', 'edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.\\n', 'Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now\\n', 'near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\\n', 'her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though\\n', 'in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\\n', 'gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,\\n', 'which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,\\n', '\"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\\n', 'Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\" And then, with a\\n', 'slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\\n', '\\n', 'With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\n', 'Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\\n', 'perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written\\n', 'quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\\n', 'full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\\n', \"from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\\n\", '\\n', '\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension\\n', 'of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those\\n', 'offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\\n', 'intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes\\n', 'which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\\n', 'effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\\n', 'should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\\n', 'and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\n', 'your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\\n', 'demand it of your justice.\\n', '\\n', '\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\\n', 'magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\\n', 'that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\\n', 'from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\\n', 'claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\\n', 'prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\\n', 'wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\n', 'favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\n', 'dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\\n', 'its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\\n', 'persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\\n', 'bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\\n', 'night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\\n', 'to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions\\n', 'and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which\\n', 'is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\\n', 'may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity\\n', 'must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\\n', '\\n', '\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\\n', 'others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young\\n', 'woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance\\n', 'at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious\\n', 'attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I\\n', 'had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir\\n', \"William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to\\n\", 'your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\\n', 'He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could\\n', \"be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour\\n\", 'attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss\\n', 'Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\\n', 'watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,\\n', 'but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced\\n', \"from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions\\n\", 'with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\\n', 'sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been\\n', 'in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter\\n', 'probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict\\n', 'pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not\\n', \"scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and\\n\", 'air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\\n', 'that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\\n', 'easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\\n', 'certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions\\n', 'are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe\\n', 'her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial\\n', 'conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the\\n', 'marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have\\n', 'the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of\\n', 'connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But\\n', 'there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still\\n', 'existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had\\n', 'myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\\n', 'me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your\\n', \"mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that\\n\", 'total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by\\n', 'herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your\\n', 'father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern\\n', 'for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\n', 'representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to\\n', 'have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,\\n', 'is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than\\n', 'it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say\\n', 'farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties\\n', 'was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led\\n', 'me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\n', 'connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as\\n', 'you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\\n', '\\n', '\"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters\\' uneasiness\\n', 'had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was\\n', 'soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in\\n', 'detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in\\n', 'London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office\\n', 'of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I\\n', 'described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance\\n', 'might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\\n', 'that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\\n', 'seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your\\n', \"sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\\n\", 'affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\\n', 'natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his\\n', 'own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was\\n', 'no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into\\n', 'Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the\\n', 'work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There\\n', 'is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not\\n', 'reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the\\n', \"measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in\\n\", 'town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her\\n', 'brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without\\n', 'ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me\\n', 'enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\\n', 'concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it\\n', 'was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no\\n', \"other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it\\n\", 'was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to\\n', 'you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\\n', 'them.\\n', '\\n', '\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured\\n', 'Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his\\n', 'connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I\\n', 'am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more\\n', 'than one witness of undoubted veracity.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many\\n', 'years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good\\n', 'conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to\\n', 'be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his\\n', 'kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at\\n', 'school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his\\n', 'own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\\n', \"been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only\\n\", \"fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he\\n\", 'had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be\\n', 'his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is\\n', 'many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different\\n', 'manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was\\n', 'careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\\n', 'the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,\\n', 'and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.\\n', 'Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree\\n', 'you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham\\n', 'has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from\\n', 'unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.\\n', '\\n', '\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to\\n', 'Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly\\n', 'recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner\\n', 'that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a\\n', 'valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There\\n', 'was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\\n', 'survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham\\n', 'wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,\\n', 'he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more\\n', 'immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\\n', 'could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying\\n', 'law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\\n', 'be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed\\n', 'him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to\\n', 'his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the\\n', 'business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance\\n', 'in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\\n', 'receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\\n', 'between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\\n', 'to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly\\n', 'lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free\\n', 'from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\\n', 'For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\\n', 'incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to\\n', 'me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured\\n', 'me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He\\n', 'had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\\n', 'resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in\\n', 'question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was\\n', 'well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not\\n', \"have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame\\n\", 'me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every\\n', 'repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of\\n', 'his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\\n', 'to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every\\n', 'appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But\\n', 'last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\n', '\\n', '\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,\\n', 'and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold\\n', 'to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your\\n', 'secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to\\n', \"the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.\\n\", 'About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed\\n', 'for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided\\n', 'over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by\\n', 'design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him\\n', 'and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and\\n', 'by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\\n', 'whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to\\n', 'her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and\\n', 'to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\\n', 'excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed\\n', 'the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two\\n', 'before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\\n', 'idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\\n', 'a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and\\n', \"how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented\\n\", 'any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place\\n', 'immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.\\n', \"Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which\\n\", 'is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of\\n', 'revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have\\n', 'been complete indeed.\\n', '\\n', '\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have\\n', 'been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as\\n', 'false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.\\n', 'Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he\\n', 'had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered\\n', 'at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,\\n', 'detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in\\n', 'your inclination.\\n', '\\n', '\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but\\n', 'I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to\\n', 'be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more\\n', 'particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our\\n', 'near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of\\n', \"the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted\\n\", 'with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_\\n', 'should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by\\n', 'the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be\\n', 'the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some\\n', 'opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the\\n', 'morning. I will only add, God bless you.\\n', '\\n', '\"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 36\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\\n', 'contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\\n', 'its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly\\n', 'she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\\n', 'Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\\n', 'she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\\n', 'and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\n', 'to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\\n', 'prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what\\n', 'had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly\\n', 'left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the\\n', 'next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of\\n', \"the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she\\n\", 'instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst\\n', 'objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing\\n', 'him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied\\n', 'her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and\\n', 'insolence.\\n', '\\n', 'But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\\n', 'she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,\\n', 'if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\\n', 'bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her\\n', 'feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\\n', 'Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\\n', 'to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\n', 'This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\"--and when she had\\n', 'gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\\n', 'last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\\n', 'regard it, that she would never look in it again.\\n', '\\n', 'In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\n', 'nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\\n', 'was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\\n', 'again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\\n', 'commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\\n', 'The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what\\n', 'he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though\\n', 'she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\\n', 'words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the\\n', 'will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\\n', 'was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\\n', 'impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\\n', 'other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\\n', 'not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the\\n', \"particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions\\n\", 'to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\n', 'thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down\\n', 'the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\\n', 'impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\\n', 'little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read\\n', 'on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\\n', 'believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\\n', \"render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\\n\", 'turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\n', '\\n', 'The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at\\n', \"Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\\n\", 'bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\\n', 'entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the\\n', 'persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\\n', 'had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life\\n', 'nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As\\n', 'to his real character, had information been in her power, she had\\n', 'never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had\\n', 'established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried\\n', 'to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of\\n', 'integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of\\n', 'Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those\\n', 'casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy\\n', \"had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But\\n\", 'no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before\\n', 'her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more\\n', 'substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\\n', 'the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After\\n', 'pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to\\n', 'read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss\\n', 'Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\\n', 'Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was\\n', 'referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam\\n', 'himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his\\n', \"near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no\\n\", 'reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\\n', 'him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and\\n', 'at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never\\n', 'have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\\n', \"cousin's corroboration.\\n\", '\\n', 'She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\\n', \"between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.\\n\", 'Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\\n', 'struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\\n', 'wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\\n', 'himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\\n', 'with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\n', 'of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\\n', '_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\\n', 'the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield\\n', 'family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\\n', 'herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;\\n', \"that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's\\n\", 'character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\\n', 'always prevent his exposing the son.\\n', '\\n', 'How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!\\n', 'His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\\n', 'hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\\n', 'the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\\n', 'His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\\n', 'either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\n', 'his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\\n', 'incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\\n', 'and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\\n', 'but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\\n', 'asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\\n', 'were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\\n', 'acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\\n', 'together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\\n', 'that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\\n', 'of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was\\n', 'esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\\n', 'brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\\n', 'sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his\\n', 'actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\\n', 'everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\\n', 'that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\\n', 'as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\\n', '\\n', 'She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\\n', 'could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,\\n', 'absurd.\\n', '\\n', '\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided myself\\n', 'on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\\n', 'often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified\\n', 'my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this\\n', 'discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could\\n', 'not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my\\n', 'folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\\n', 'of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\n', 'prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were\\n', 'concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\\n', \"which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation\\n\", '_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely\\n', 'different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\\n', 'credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to\\n', 'give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her\\n', \"sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's\\n\", 'opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his\\n', \"description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were\\n\", 'little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air\\n', 'and manner not often united with great sensibility.\\n', '\\n', 'When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\n', 'mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense\\n', 'of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\\n', 'for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as\\n', 'having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\\n', 'disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\\n', 'than on hers.\\n', '\\n', 'The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,\\n', 'but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been\\n', 'self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered\\n', \"that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest\\n\", 'relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\\n', 'by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\\n', 'had ever known before.\\n', '\\n', 'After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\\n', 'variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,\\n', 'and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and\\n', 'so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made\\n', 'her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish\\n', 'of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such\\n', 'reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\\n', '\\n', 'She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\\n', 'called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\\n', 'leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\\n', 'an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\\n', 'till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern\\n', 'in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.

To Rosings he then\\n', 'hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\n', 'brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,\\n', 'importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\\n', 'having them all to dine with her.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\\n', 'she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as\\n', 'her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\\n', 'ladyship\\'s indignation would have been. \"What would she have said? how\\n', 'would she have behaved?\" were questions with which she amused herself.\\n', '\\n', 'Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. \"I assure\\n', 'you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe no one\\n', 'feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\\n', 'attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to\\n', 'me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are.

When my\\n', 'niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\n', 'having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of\\n', 'Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\\n', 'propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\\n', 'things.

If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\\n', 'attended to.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,\\n', 'and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,\\n', 'which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so\\n', 'occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be\\n', 'reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it\\n', 'as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary\\n', 'walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\\n', 'recollections.\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\\n\", 'studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\\n', 'times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\\n', 'she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly\\n', 'she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\\n', 'herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\\n', 'His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she\\n', 'could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\\n', 'or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\\n', 'behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in\\n', 'the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\\n', 'They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\\n', 'them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\\n', 'youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\n', 'herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\\n', 'united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\\n', \"and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,\\n\", 'what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\\n', \"irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always\\n\", 'affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\n', 'scarcely give them a hearing.

While\\n', 'there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\\n', 'Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there\\n', 'forever.\\n', '\\n', \"Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's\\n\", 'explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\\n', 'heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.

How\\n', 'grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every\\n', 'respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\n', 'been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\n', '\\n', \"When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's\\n\", 'character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\\n', 'seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it\\n', 'almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\\n', '\\n', 'Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\\n', 'her stay as they had been at first.

Our plain\\n', 'manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we\\n', 'see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\n', 'yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,\\n', 'and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending\\n', 'your time unpleasantly.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She\\n', 'had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\\n', 'Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_\\n', 'feel the obliged.

Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\\n', 'that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\\n', 'marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\\n', 'thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\n', 'character and ideas between us.

I dare say he often hears worse\\n', 'things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\\n', 'he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\\n', 'my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?\\n', \"There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you!

Well, now\\n', 'let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\\n', 'home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\\n', 'since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\\n', 'flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\\n', 'before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\n', 'She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not\\n', 'being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to\\n', \"get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\\n\", 'Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\\n', 'how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would\\n', 'chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\\n', \"of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend\\n\", 'the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\\n', 'evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\\n', 'she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\\n', 'was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\\n', \"dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a\\n\", 'lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\\n', 'Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\\n', 'one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\\n', 'and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\\n', 'did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\\n', 'Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\\n', 'something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\"\\n', '\\n', 'With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\n', \"Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\\n\", 'companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\\n', \"could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.\\n\", '\\n', 'Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\\n', 'in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\\n', 'say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\n', '\\n', '\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\\n', 'came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that\\n', 'occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and\\n', 'poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one\\n', 'hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat\\n', 'some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\\n', \"Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,\\n\", 'was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who\\n', 'would hear her.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\\n', 'As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there\\n', 'was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty\\n', 'had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved\\n', 'very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold\\n', 'luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated\\n', 'you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never\\n', 'should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then\\n', 'we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that\\n', 'anybody might have heard us ten miles off!\"\\n', '\\n', 'To this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister,\\n', 'to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the\\n', 'generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\\n', '_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\\n', 'anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\\n', '\\n', 'In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk\\n', 'to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily\\n', 'opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could\\n', 'not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.\\n', 'There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.\\n', 'Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The\\n', \"comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond\\n\", 'expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped\\n', 'there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\n', '\\n', 'She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton\\n', 'scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\\n', 'frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\\n', 'father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\\n', 'at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\n', 'disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 40\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could\\n\", 'no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every\\n', 'particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be\\n', 'surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene\\n', 'between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n', '\\n', \"Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\\n\", 'partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\\n', 'natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\\n', 'sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\\n', 'little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\\n', \"unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.\\n\", '\\n', '\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and certainly\\n', 'ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\\n', 'disappointment!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\\n', 'other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\\n', 'You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Blame you! Oh, no.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next\\n', 'day.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\\n', 'as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!\\n', 'who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\\n', 'so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here\\n', \"collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though\\n\", 'grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\\n', 'Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\\n', 'seek to clear the one without involving the other.\\n', '\\n', '\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to make both\\n', 'of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\\n', 'with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\\n', 'enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\\n', \"about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;\\n\", 'but you shall do as you choose.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she. \"Wickham so\\n', 'very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only\\n', 'consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the\\n', 'knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing\\n', 'of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it\\n', 'so.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so\\n', 'full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am\\n', 'growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion\\n', 'makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will\\n', 'be as light as a feather.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\n', 'countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\\n', 'two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\\n', 'appearance of it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\\n', 'used to do.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\\n', \"to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an\\n\", 'opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\\n', 'abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing\\n', 'at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\\n', 'the matter as you do now.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And\\n', 'with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say\\n', 'that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I\\n', 'had! Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\\n', 'in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\\n', 'undeserved.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\\n', 'natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There\\n', 'is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\\n', 'ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand\\n', 'Wickham\\'s character.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can be no\\n', 'occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me\\n', 'to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\\n', 'relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\\n', 'myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\\n', 'conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy\\n', 'is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\\n', 'Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal\\n', 'to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\\n', 'anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,\\n', 'and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At\\n', 'present I will say nothing about it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\\n', 'ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\\n', 're-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\"\\n', '\\n', \"The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had\\n\", 'got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,\\n', 'and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish\\n', 'to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,\\n', 'of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other\\n', \"half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she\\n\", 'had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one\\n', 'could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\\n', 'understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off\\n', 'this last encumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very\\n', 'improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to\\n', 'tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The\\n', 'liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\n', '\\n', 'She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\\n', \"state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\\n\", 'very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself\\n', 'in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,\\n', 'and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first\\n', 'attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,\\n', 'and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her\\n', 'attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the\\n', 'indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own\\n', 'health and their tranquillity.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion _now_ of\\n', \"this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak\\n\", 'of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But\\n', 'I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is\\n', \"a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least\\n\", 'chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of\\n', 'his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\\n', 'everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I\\n', 'shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I\\n', 'would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will\\n', 'die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,\\n', 'she made no answer.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so the\\n', 'Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope\\n', 'it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\\n', 'excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her\\n', 'mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\\n', 'housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, nothing at all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will\\n', 'take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\\n', 'for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\\n', 'talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as\\n', 'quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they\\n', 'often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\\n', 'estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be\\n', 'ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 41\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\\n', \"the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies\\n\", 'in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\\n', 'universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\\n', 'and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\\n', 'frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\\n', 'Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\n', 'hard-heartedness in any of the family.\\n', '\\n', '\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?\" would they\\n', 'often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \"How can you be smiling so,\\n', 'Lizzy?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\\n', 'she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years\\n', 'ago.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when Colonel\\n', 'Miller\\'s regiment went away.

Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\\n', \"of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's\\n\", 'objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his\\n', 'interference in the views of his friend.\\n', '\\n', \"But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\\n\", 'received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of\\n', 'the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.

A resemblance in good humour\\n', 'and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\\n', \"their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\\n\", '\\n', 'The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\\n', 'the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\\n', \"to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia\\n\", \"flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's\\n\", 'congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\\n', 'whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate\\n', 'in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\n', '\\n', '\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\"\\n', 'said she, \"Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much\\n', 'right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\\n', 'her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\\n', 'exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\\n', 'considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense\\n', 'for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it\\n', 'known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\\n', \"go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general\\n\", 'behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\\n', 'such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\n', 'imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\\n', 'be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:\\n', '\\n', '\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public\\n', 'place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so\\n', 'little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\\n', 'circumstances.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great disadvantage to\\n', \"us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and\\n\", 'imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\\n', 'would judge differently in the affair.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet. \"What, has she frightened away\\n', 'some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\\n', 'squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\\n', 'are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who\\n', 'have been kept aloof by Lydia\\'s folly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\\n', 'of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\\n', 'importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the\\n', 'wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\\n', \"Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\\n\", 'father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\\n', 'of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\\n', 'her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\\n', 'will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\n', 'that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\\n', 'worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\\n', 'youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness\\n', 'of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\\n', 'contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger\\n', 'Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\\n', 'ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you\\n', 'suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\n', 'they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\\n', 'disgrace?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\n', 'affectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\n', '\\n', '\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known\\n', 'you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\\n', 'advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\\n', 'sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\\n', 'Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\\n', 'keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\\n', 'object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\\n', 'even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\\n', 'women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\\n', 'there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\\n', 'many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest\\n', 'of her life.\"\\n', '\\n', 'With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\\n', 'continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\\n', 'in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on\\n', 'them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret\\n', 'over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\\n', 'disposition.\\n', '\\n', 'Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\\n', 'father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\\n', \"united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\\n\", 'every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\\n', 'of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\\n', 'She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them\\n', 'at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents\\n', 'stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\\n', 'and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\\n', 'saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\\n', 'officers at once.\\n', '\\n', 'Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such\\n', 'realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have\\n', 'been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.\\n', \"Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy\\n\", \"conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.\\n\", '\\n', 'But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\\n', \"continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving\\n\", 'home.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\\n', 'frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\\n', 'well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\\n', 'learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted\\n', 'her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\\n', 'behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\\n', 'for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\n', 'had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\\n', 'what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\\n', 'finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\\n', 'gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\\n', 'reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\\n', 'cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\\n', 'and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\\n', '\\n', \"On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,\\n\", 'with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\\n', 'disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\\n', 'inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\\n', \"mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\\n\", 'weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\n', '\\n', \"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's\\n\", 'recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\\n', 'him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\\n', 'asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\\n', 'With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:\\n', '\\n', '\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \"And\\n', 'pray, may I ask?--\" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, \"Is\\n', 'it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility\\n', 'to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,\" he continued in a lower\\n', 'and more serious tone, \"that he is improved in essentials.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is very much\\n', 'what he ever was.\"\\n', '\\n', 'While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\\n', 'rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\\n', 'something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\\n', 'and anxious attention, while she added:\\n', '\\n', '\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\\n', 'his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from\\n', 'knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\\n\", 'look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his\\n', 'embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\\n', 'accents:\\n', '\\n', '\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\\n', 'comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\\n', 'even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\\n', 'may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only\\n', 'deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only\\n', 'fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been\\n', 'alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\\n', 'opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always\\n', 'operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be\\n', 'imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I\\n', 'am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\\n', 'slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\\n', 'the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\\n', 'him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his\\n', 'side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\\n', 'Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\\n', 'mutual desire of never meeting again.\\n', '\\n', 'When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\\n', 'from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\\n', 'between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\\n', 'only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\\n', 'and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\\n', 'opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which\\n', 'there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in\\n', 'the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more\\n', 'gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 42\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\\n\", 'not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic\\n', 'comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\\n', 'of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\\n', 'woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\\n', 'their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\\n', 'esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views\\n', 'of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of\\n', 'a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\\n', 'imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often\\n', 'console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\\n', 'the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\\n', 'enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\\n', 'her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\\n', 'the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\\n', 'wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\n', 'philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\\n', \"father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\\n\", 'respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\\n', 'herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\\n', 'banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\\n', 'and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\\n', 'children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\\n', 'strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\\n', 'unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\\n', 'from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\\n', 'might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\\n', 'if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\n', '\\n', \"When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little\\n\", 'other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\\n', 'abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and\\n', 'sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around\\n', 'them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\\n', 'might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\\n', 'of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\\n', 'greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all\\n', 'her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\n', 'watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\\n', 'has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been\\n', 'looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the\\n', 'satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\\n', 'name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have\\n', 'some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\\n', 'again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\\n', 'present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\\n', 'was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\\n', 'for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\\n', 'and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\\n', 'scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\n', '\\n', '\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish for.\\n', 'Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\\n', 'But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\\n', \"sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\\n\", 'pleasure realised.

Those to her mother contained little else than that\\n', 'they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\\n', 'had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\\n', 'made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\n', 'she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\\n', 'violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to\\n', 'the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still\\n', 'less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were\\n', 'much too full of lines under the words to be made public.\\n', '\\n', 'After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good\\n', 'humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore\\n', 'a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came\\n', 'back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\\n', 'was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of\\n', 'June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\\n', 'tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by\\n', 'the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\\n', 'mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious\\n', 'arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in\\n', 'Meryton.\\n', '\\n', 'The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\\n', 'approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\\n', 'arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\\n', 'curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\\n', 'setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\\n', 'within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so\\n', 'far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\\n', 'the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\\n', 'the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the\\n', 'present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that\\n', 'county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\\n', 'weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\\n', 'town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\\n', 'they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\\n', 'her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\n', 'Dovedale, or the Peak.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\\n', 'the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\\n', 'was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\\n', 'and all was soon right again.\\n', '\\n', 'With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was\\n', 'impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\\n', 'owner. \"But surely,\" said she, \"I may enter his county with impunity,\\n', 'and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\\n', \"before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.\\n\", 'and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\\n', 'Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\\n', 'younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their\\n', 'cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\\n', 'sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\\n', 'way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\n', '\\n', 'The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\\n', 'next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\\n', 'One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;\\n', 'a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\\n', 'inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\\n', 'and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\\n', 'disappointments abroad.\\n', '\\n', 'It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\\n', 'nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\\n', 'lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are\\n', 'sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\\n', \"concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's\\n\", 'former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance\\n', 'still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the\\n', 'principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,\\n', 'Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not\\n', 'in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\\n', 'talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed\\n', 'an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\\n', 'willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\n', '\\n', '\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard\\n', 'so much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so many of your\\n', 'acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\\n', 'know.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\\n', 'Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\\n', 'must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so\\n', 'many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \"If it were merely a fine house\\n', 'richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it myself; but\\n', 'the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\\n', 'country.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The\\n', 'possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\\n', 'occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and\\n', 'thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such\\n', 'a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\\n', 'that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the\\n', 'absence of the family were unfavourably answered.\\n', '\\n', 'Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\\n', 'whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its\\n', 'proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\\n', 'the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\\n', 'alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\n', 'curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\\n', 'next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\\n', 'with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\\n', 'to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 43\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\\n', 'Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\\n', 'in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\n', '\\n', 'The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\\n', 'entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\\n', 'a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\\n\", 'every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\\n', 'half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\\n', 'eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\\n', 'Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which\\n', 'the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\\n', 'building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of\\n', 'high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\\n', 'swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\\n', 'were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\\n', 'had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\\n', 'beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\\n', 'all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\\n', 'to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\n', '\\n', 'They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\\n', 'while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\\n', 'meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\\n', 'mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\\n', 'hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\\n', 'wonder at her being where she was.\\n', '\\n', 'The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less\\n', 'fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\\n', 'followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned\\n', 'room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\\n', 'to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which\\n', 'they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\\n', 'was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and\\n', 'she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its\\n', 'banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,\\n', 'with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking\\n', 'different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be\\n', 'seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to\\n', 'the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of\\n', 'his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\\n', 'splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\n', '\\n', '\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress! With\\n', 'these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\\n', 'viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\\n', 'welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\"--recollecting\\n', 'herself--\"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\\n', 'me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like\\n', 'regret.\\n', '\\n', 'She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really\\n', 'absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question\\n', 'was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\\n', 'Reynolds replied that he was, adding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with\\n', 'a large party of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\\n', 'journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\n', '\\n', 'Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the\\n', 'likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,\\n', 'over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\\n', 'The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young\\n', \"gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought\\n\", 'up by him at his own expense. \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\\n', '\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\\n', 'return it.\\n', '\\n', '\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\\n', '\"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\\n', 'other--about eight years ago.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\\n', 'looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\\n', 'us whether it is like or not.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\n', 'intimation of her knowing her master.\\n', '\\n', '\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you\\n', 'will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.

He was very fond of them.\"\\n', '\\n', \"This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.\\n\", '\\n', 'Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\\n', 'when she was only eight years old.\\n', '\\n', '\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\\n', 'accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is\\n', 'a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she\\n', 'comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her\\n', 'communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either\\n', 'by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\\n', 'master and his sister.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\\n', 'time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\\n', 'good enough for him.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is\\n', 'very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,\"\\n', 'replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she\\n', 'listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \"I have\\n', 'never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever\\n', 'since he was four years old.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\\n', 'ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\\n', 'Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was\\n', 'grateful to her uncle for saying:\\n', '\\n', '\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\\n', 'having such a master.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could\\n', 'not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\\n', 'good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and\\n', 'he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\\n', 'world.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth almost stared at her. \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\" thought she.\\n', '\\n', '\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\\n', 'as affable to the poor.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\\n', 'Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\\n', 'of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\\n', 'furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\\n', 'prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\\n', 'master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\\n', 'many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\n', '\\n', '\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever\\n', 'lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but\\n', 'themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give\\n', 'him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw\\n', 'anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away\\n', 'like other young men.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked, \"is not\\n', 'quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\n', '\\n', 'On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty\\n', 'sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\\n', 'the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\\n', 'give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when\\n', 'last at Pemberley.\\n', '\\n', '\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\\n', 'one of the windows.\\n', '\\n', \"Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter\\n\", 'the room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added. \"Whatever\\n', 'can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There\\n', 'is nothing he would not do for her.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were\\n', 'all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;\\n', 'but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\\n', 'visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\\n', \"Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\\n\", 'also more intelligible.\\n', '\\n', 'In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\\n', 'little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of\\n', 'the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested\\n', 'her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a\\n', 'smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he\\n', 'looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest\\n', 'contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\\n', \"Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's\\n\", 'lifetime.\\n', '\\n', \"There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\\n\", 'sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of\\n', 'their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\\n', 'was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\\n', 'of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\\n', \"considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how\\n\", 'much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of\\n', 'good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\\n', 'forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\\n', 'stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his\\n', 'eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\\n', 'gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\\n', 'softened its impropriety of expression.\\n', '\\n', 'When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\\n', 'they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\\n', 'consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.\\n', '\\n', 'As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\\n', 'to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former\\n', 'was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\\n', 'suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\\n', '\\n', 'They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\\n', 'appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\\n', 'instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\\n', 'blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\\n', 'surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\\n', 'and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\\n', 'of perfect civility.\\n', '\\n', 'She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\n', 'received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\\n', 'overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\\n', 'they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\\n', \"that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\\n\", 'beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\\n', 'aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\n', 'scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer\\n', 'she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\\n', 'alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\\n', 'he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\\n', 'impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\\n', 'minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\\n', 'her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent\\n', 'had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as\\n', 'to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in\\n', 'Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\\n', 'distraction of his thoughts.\\n', '\\n', 'At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\\n', 'moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\\n', 'leave.\\n', '\\n', 'The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but\\n', 'Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,\\n', 'followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her\\n', 'coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the\\n', 'world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light\\n', 'might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely\\n', 'thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he\\n', 'thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\\n', 'sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;\\n', 'for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted\\n', 'from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over\\n', 'the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly\\n', 'altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was\\n', 'amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\\n', 'Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never\\n', 'had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What\\n', 'a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put\\n', 'his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account\\n', 'for it.\\n', '\\n', 'They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\\n', 'every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\\n', 'reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\\n', 'before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\\n', 'mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\\n', 'seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\\n', 'distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\\n', 'one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\n', 'was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in\\n', 'what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\\n', 'she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\\n', 'felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\\n', 'not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\\n', 'seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\\n', 'composure.\\n', '\\n', 'At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\\n', 'aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\\n', '\\n', 'They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\\n', 'ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\\n', 'the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\\n', 'valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\\n', 'many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\\n', 'of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\\n', 'With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\\n', 'It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which\\n', 'brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,\\n', 'to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed\\n', 'it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\\n', 'it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\\n', 'valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\\n', 'and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\\n', 'Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\\n', 'bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\\n', 'who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\\n', 'of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\\n', 'therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\\n', 'on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\\n', 'progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\\n', 'taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\\n', 'occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\\n', 'man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\\n', \"slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment\\n\", 'was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\\n', 'approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here\\n', 'less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\n', 'they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\\n', 'for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\\n', 'calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\\n', 'she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\\n', 'lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\\n', 'turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw\\n', 'that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\\n', 'politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\\n', 'but she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when\\n', 'some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\\n', 'Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,\\n', 'and she said no more.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\\n', 'her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\\n', 'This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;\\n', 'and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\\n', 'acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had\\n', 'revolted in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\" thought\\n', 'she, \"when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of\\n', 'fashion.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\\n', 'relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\\n', 'it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\\n', 'could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\\n', 'connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\\n', 'so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\\n', 'conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\\n', 'could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had\\n', 'some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\\n', 'attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\\n', 'expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\\n', 'his taste, or his good manners.\\n', '\\n', 'The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\\n', 'invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\\n', 'chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time\\n', 'to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\\n', 'the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\\n', 'walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\\n', 'Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\\n', 'must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\\n', 'continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered? From what can\\n', 'it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his\\n', 'manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\\n', 'change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\"\\n', '\\n', 'After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\\n', 'gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to\\n', 'the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\\n', 'water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated\\n', 'in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\\n', \"Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\\n\", \"her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\\n\", 'together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him\\n', 'to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\\n', 'place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\n', 'very unexpected--\"for your housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that\\n', 'you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\\n', 'left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected\\n', 'in the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\\n', 'business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\\n', 'before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \"They\\n', 'will join me early to-morrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some\\n', 'who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\\n', \"driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last\\n\", 'mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_\\n', 'mind was not very differently engaged.\\n', '\\n', '\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a\\n', 'pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\\n', 'me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\\n', 'during your stay at Lambton?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\\n', 'for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\\n', 'that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her\\n', 'must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was\\n', 'satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\\n', 'him think really ill of her.\\n', '\\n', 'They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\\n', 'was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\\n', 'pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\\n', 'the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\\n', 'reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\\n', 'mile behind.\\n', '\\n', 'He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\\n', 'tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\\n', 'have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\\n', 'there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected\\n', 'that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale\\n', 'with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her\\n', 'patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was\\n', \"over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go\\n\", 'into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and\\n', 'they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\\n', 'ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\\n', 'walking slowly towards the house.\\n', '\\n', 'The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\\n', 'pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\\n', '\"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\\n', '\\n', '\"There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\\n', 'aunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\\n', 'say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I\\n', 'have seen nothing of it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\\n', 'than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\\n', 'attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham;\\n', \"or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features\\n\", 'are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so\\n', 'disagreeable?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\\n', 'him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never\\n', 'seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\n', '\\n', '\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\" replied\\n', 'her uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\\n', 'at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off\\n', 'his grounds.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but\\n', 'said nothing.\\n', '\\n', '\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I really\\n', 'should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\\n', 'anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\\n', 'On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\\n', 'speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would\\n', 'not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\\n', 'good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\n', 'I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\\n', 'master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every\\n', 'virtue.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\\n', 'his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in\\n', 'as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from\\n', 'his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\\n', 'construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\\n', \"Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\\n\", 'confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\n', 'transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\\n', 'her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\\n', 'approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\\n', 'the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\\n', 'to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\\n', \"anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they\\n\", 'had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\\n', 'acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a\\n', \"intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.\\n\", '\\n', 'The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\\n', 'much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\\n', \"but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above\\n\", 'all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 44\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\\n', 'her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\\n', 'resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\\n', 'But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their\\n', 'arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\\n', 'place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn\\n', 'to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\\n', 'carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\\n', 'a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\\n', 'the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\\n', 'surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\\n', 'expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\\n', 'of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\\n', 'of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\\n', 'the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\\n', 'there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\\n', 'quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\\n', 'newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\\n', \"Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\\n\", 'amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\\n', 'she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\\n', 'in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\\n', 'suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\\n', '\\n', 'She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\\n', 'up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\\n', 'inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\\n', 'took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\\n', 'acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\\n', 'being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\\n', 'but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\\n', 'only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\\n', 'her beyond a monosyllable.\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\\n', 'little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\\n', 'womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\\n', 'was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\\n', 'unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\\n', 'acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\\n', 'relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\n', '\\n', 'They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley\\n', 'was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\\n', \"satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick\\n\", 'step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\\n', \"Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\\n\", 'felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\\n', 'cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\\n', 'inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\\n', 'and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\n', '\\n', 'To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\\n', 'than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\\n', 'them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\\n', 'arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\\n', 'each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\\n', 'those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\\n', \"what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little\\n\", 'in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\\n', 'evident enough.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\\n', 'feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and\\n', 'to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\\n', 'feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\\n', 'endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\\n', 'was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\n', '\\n', 'In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\\n', 'how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\\n', 'a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\\n', 'former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\\n', 'that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\\n', 'though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\\n', 'behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\\n', 'appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\\n', 'between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point\\n', 'she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred\\n', 'ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\\n', 'recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\\n', 'more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\\n', 'to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\\n', 'which had something of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since\\n', 'he had had the pleasure of seeing her;\" and, before she could reply,\\n', 'he added, \"It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of\\n', 'November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\\n', 'took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\\n', '_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\\n', 'nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\\n', 'gave them meaning.\\n', '\\n', 'It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\\n', 'but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\\n', 'complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\\n', 'from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\\n', 'the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\\n', 'temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\\n', 'she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\\n', 'of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\\n', 'disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\\n', 'very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\\n', 'lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\\n', 'so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\\n', 'restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\\n', 'of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\\n', 'at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\n', 'self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\\n', 'could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\\n', 'acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\\n', 'down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\\n', 'Rosings.\\n', '\\n', 'Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose\\n', 'to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\\n', 'their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\\n', 'at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\\n', 'diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\\n', 'readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\\n', 'how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\n', 'acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\\n', 'that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\\n', 'any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\\n', 'society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\\n', 'her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\\n', '\\n', 'Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\\n', 'again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\\n', 'make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\\n', 'this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\\n', 'this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\\n', 'visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\\n', 'satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\\n', 'little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\\n', 'uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\\n', 'favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\n', '\\n', \"But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\\n\", 'not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\\n', 'much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\\n', 'it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\\n', 'interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\\n', '\\n', 'Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\\n', 'as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\\n', 'not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\\n', \"from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference\\n\", 'to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\\n', 'would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\\n', 'however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\\n', 'that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\\n', 'years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\\n', 'hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\\n', 'their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\\n', 'nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\\n', 'it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\\n', 'where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\\n', 'was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\\n', '\\n', 'With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\\n', 'there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\\n', 'son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\\n', 'fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\\n', 'him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\\n', '\\n', 'As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\\n', 'the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\\n', 'long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\\n', 'and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\\n', 'certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\\n', 'had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\\n', 'that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\\n', 'valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\\n', 'time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\\n', 'into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\\n', 'his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\\n', 'which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\\n', 'there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\\n', 'It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\\n', 'but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\\n', 'acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\\n', 'accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\\n', 'her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\\n', 'eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\\n', 'of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\\n', 'were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\\n', 'on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\\n', 'pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\\n', 'love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\\n', 'sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\\n', 'exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\\n', 'she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\\n', 'far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would\\n', 'be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her\\n', 'fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of\\n', 'his addresses.\\n', '\\n', 'It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that\\n', \"such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the\\n\", 'very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a\\n', 'late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,\\n', 'by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that\\n', 'it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\\n', 'morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\\n', 'she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\\n', 'renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\\n', 'some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 45\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had\\n\", 'originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her\\n', 'appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how\\n', \"much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.\\n\", '\\n', 'On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\\n', 'whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows\\n', 'opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\\n', 'hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\\n', 'which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\\n', '\\n', 'In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\\n', 'with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\\n', \"London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with\\n\", 'all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear\\n', 'of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior\\n', 'the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\\n', 'however, did her justice, and pitied her.\\n', '\\n', 'By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,\\n', 'on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\\n', 'succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\\n', 'genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\\n', 'of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\\n', 'others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\n', 'Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\\n', 'wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\\n', 'short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\\n', 'and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\\n', 'calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\\n', 'from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\\n', 'inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\\n', 'of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\\n', 'moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\\n', 'feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\n', 'she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\\n', 'sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss\\n', \"Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\\n\", 'inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\\n', 'indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\n', '\\n', 'The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\\n', 'entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\\n', 'finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many\\n', 'a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\\n', 'given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\\n', 'party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\n', 'beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\\n', 'them round the table.\\n', '\\n', 'While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\\n', 'she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\\n', 'feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\\n', 'a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\\n', 'regret that he came.\\n', '\\n', 'He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\\n', 'gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\\n', 'only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\\n', 'Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely\\n', 'resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\\n', 'necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\\n', 'saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\\n', 'and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\\n', 'when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\\n', \"curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\\n\", 'smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\\n', 'objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\\n', \"to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\\n\", 'entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\\n', 'was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\\n', 'as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\\n', 'Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\\n', 'first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\n', '\\n', '\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\\n', 'They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\"\\n', '\\n', \"In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\\n\", 'instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\\n', \"various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\\n\", 'but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\\n', 'presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While\\n', 'she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened\\n', 'complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\\n', 'confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\\n', 'pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would\\n', 'have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\\n', 'Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\\n', 'her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\\n', \"Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\\n\", 'and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected\\n', \"with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's\\n\", 'meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\n', \"was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections\\n\", 'her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\\n', 'wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\\n', 'hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\\n', 'meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\\n', 'Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\\n', 'for the welfare of his friend.\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\\n\", 'as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\\n', 'Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\\n', 'to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\\n', 'recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\\n', 'had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\\n', 'fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\n', '\\n', 'Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\\n', 'mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss\\n', \"Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,\\n\", \"behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's\\n\", 'recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not\\n', 'err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana\\n', 'without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When\\n', 'Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\\n', 'him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\n', '\\n', '\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she\\n', 'cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since\\n', 'the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing\\n', 'that we should not have known her again.\"\\n', '\\n', 'However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\\n', 'himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than\\n', 'her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\\n', 'summer.\\n', '\\n', '\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could\\n', 'see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\\n', 'brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose\\n', 'wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\\n', 'tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,\\n', 'which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything\\n', 'extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do\\n', 'not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency\\n', 'without fashion, which is intolerable.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\\n', 'the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\\n', 'wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\\n', 'success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\\n', 'determination of making him speak, she continued:\\n', '\\n', '\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\\n', 'were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\\n', \"your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_\\n\", \"a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\\n\", 'seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\\n', 'one time.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but _that_\\n', 'was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have\\n', 'considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\\n', 'having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\\n', 'visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\\n', 'both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\\n', 'except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\\n', 'of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but\\n', 'himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\\n', \"him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's\\n\", 'beginning the subject.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 46\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\\n', 'Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\\n', 'renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but\\n', 'on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\\n', 'receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\\n', 'it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\\n', 'Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\n', '\\n', 'They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and\\n', 'her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\\n', 'themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\\n', 'written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\\n', 'little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\\n', 'but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\\n', 'agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:\\n', '\\n', '\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\\n', 'most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\\n', 'assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\\n', 'An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\\n', 'from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\\n', 'with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\\n', 'surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\\n', 'very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\\n', 'to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\\n', 'Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step\\n', '(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\\n', 'disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\\n', 'Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\\n', 'thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against\\n', 'him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\\n', 'twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\n', 'eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\\n', 'passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\\n', 'him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\\n', 'their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\\n', 'mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\\n', 'know what I have written.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\\n', 'what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the\\n', 'other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\\n', 'had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\\n', '\\n', '\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\\n', 'wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\\n', 'head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\\n', 'Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\\n', 'and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham\\n', 'and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\\n', 'taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\n', 'to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\\n', \"day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short\\n\", 'letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\\n', 'Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\\n', 'never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was\\n', 'repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.\\n', 'intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,\\n', 'but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\\n', 'coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that\\n', 'is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.\\n', 'I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that\\n', 'side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing\\n', 'them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but\\n', 'without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With\\n', 'the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\\n', 'to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved\\n', 'for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our\\n', 'distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the\\n', 'worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make\\n', 'it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue\\n', 'their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a\\n', \"young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\\n\", 'her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that\\n', 'Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his\\n', 'head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to\\n', 'be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she\\n', 'exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And\\n', 'as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has\\n', 'anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of\\n', 'confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\\n', 'have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the\\n', 'first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not\\n', 'so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I\\n', 'take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but\\n', 'circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to\\n', 'come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,\\n', 'that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something\\n', 'more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\\n', 'Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure\\n', 'I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any\\n', 'measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to\\n', 'be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my\\n', \"uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\\n\", 'immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\\n', 'as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing\\n', 'a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was\\n', 'opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\\n', 'manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,\\n', \"she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,\\n\", 'hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\\n', 'Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not\\n', 'an instant to lose.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than\\n', 'politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute;\\n', 'but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\\n', 'not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how\\n', 'little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\\n', 'the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless\\n', 'an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\\n', 'mistress home instantly.\\n', '\\n', 'On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and\\n', 'looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\\n', 'or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\\n', '\"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\\n', 'present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There\\n', 'is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by\\n', 'some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\\n', 'not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\\n', 'something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\\n', 'silence. At length she spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from Jane,\\n', 'with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger\\n', 'sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into\\n', 'the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.\\n', '_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no\\n', 'connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Darcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she added in a yet\\n', 'more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what\\n', 'he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I\\n', 'learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\\n', 'have happened. But it is all--all too late now.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked. But is it\\n', 'certain--absolutely certain?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\\n', 'almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to\\n', 'Scotland.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle\\'s\\n', 'immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But\\n', 'nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\\n', 'such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\\n', 'not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\n', '\\n', '\"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what\\n', 'I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\\n', 'much. Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking\\n', 'up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air\\n', 'gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her\\n', 'power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\\n', 'weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\\n', 'wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\n', 'consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\\n', 'was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\\n', 'wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\\n', 'him, as now, when all love must be vain.\\n', '\\n', 'But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\\n', 'humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed\\n', 'up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\\n', 'Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\\n', 'several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by\\n', 'the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\\n', 'compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been\\n', 'long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my\\n', 'stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\\n', 'could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\\n', 'such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may\\n', 'seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I\\n', \"fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley\\n\", 'to-day.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\\n', 'urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\\n', 'long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for\\n', 'her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\\n', 'reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\\n', 'one serious, parting look, went away.\\n', '\\n', 'As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\\n', 'should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as\\n', 'had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\\n', 'retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full\\n', 'of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\\n', 'feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\\n', 'formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\\n', '\\n', \"If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\\n\", 'change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\\n', 'otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\\n', 'unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on\\n', 'a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\\n', 'exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\\n', 'somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,\\n', 'and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other\\n', 'less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him\\n', \"go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\\n\", 'produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\\n', \"business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\\n\", \"a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\\n\", 'could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\\n', 'of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\\n', 'letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\\n', 'Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\\n', 'for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\\n', 'incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\\n', 'as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose\\n', 'Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention\\n', 'of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue\\n', 'nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\n', '\\n', 'She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\\n', 'Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia\\n', 'wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\\n', 'officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\\n', 'raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been\\n', 'fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\\n', 'mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\\n', 'feel it!\\n', '\\n', 'She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\\n', 'share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\\n', 'family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\\n', 'requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\\n', \"could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\\n\", 'importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.\\n', \"and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's\\n\", 'account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them\\n', 'instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\\n', 'summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript\\n', 'of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a\\n', 'favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply\\n', 'afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the\\n', 'first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every\\n', 'assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked\\n', 'him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,\\n', 'everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to\\n', 'be off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\"\\n', 'cried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\\n', 'us; was it so?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\\n', '_That_ is all settled.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\\n', 'prepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\\n', 'truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\n', '\\n', 'But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the\\n', 'hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\\n', 'to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\\n', 'impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\\n', 'business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\\n', 'be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\\n', 'sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\\n', 'Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\\n', 'remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\\n', 'the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\\n', 'have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 47\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle, as they\\n', 'drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\\n', 'more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the\\n', 'matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should\\n', 'form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\\n', \"friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\\n\", 'am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\\n', 'would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\\n', 'regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\\n', 'not adequate to the risk!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\\n', '\\n', '\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle\\'s\\n', 'opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\\n', 'interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of\\n', 'Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\\n', 'him capable of it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\n', 'neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I\\n', 'dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been\\n', 'the case?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof\\n', 'that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such\\n', 'a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\\n', 'Barnet road.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\\n', 'for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is\\n', 'not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\\n', 'might strike them that they could be more economically, though less\\n', 'expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\\n', 'marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\\n', \"friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\\n\", 'to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\\n', 'cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she\\n', 'beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,\\n', 'forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\\n', 'restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\\n', 'dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\\n', 'nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\\n', 'other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has\\n', \"no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\\n\", 'behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\\n', 'seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\\n', 'do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\\n', 'such a matter.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him\\n', 'as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, with\\n', 'tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and virtue in such\\n', 'a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\\n', 'Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never\\n', 'been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,\\n', 'nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\n', 'and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\\n', 'and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\\n', 'Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\\n', 'flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing\\n', 'everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\\n', 'greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are\\n', 'naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\\n', 'person and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very ill of\\n', 'Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\\n', 'their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,\\n', 'till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\\n', 'Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\\n', 'sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\\n', 'as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\\n', 'as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\n', '\\n', '\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you, the other day,\\n', 'of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at\\n', 'Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved\\n', 'with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\\n', 'circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\\n', 'relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\\n', 'what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\n', 'reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\\n', 'must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\\n', 'her.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\\n', 'and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\\n', 'so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\\n', 'ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire\\n', \"was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the\\n\", 'case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\\n', 'necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could\\n', 'it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\\n', 'neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\\n', 'settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\\n', 'her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\\n', 'in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\\n', 'consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far\\n', 'enough from my thoughts.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\\n', 'suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\\n', 'side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\\n', 'that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\\n', 'he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\\n', 'were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\\n', 'the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\\n', 'attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\\n', 'wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\\n', 'who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\"\\n', '\\n', '                          * * * * *\\n', '\\n', 'It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\\n', 'to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by\\n', 'its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\\n', \"the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.\\n\", 'Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find\\n', 'no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\\n', '\\n', 'They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night\\n', 'on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a\\n', 'comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied\\n', 'by long expectations.\\n', '\\n', 'The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\\n', 'on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the\\n', 'carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\\n', 'faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\\n', 'capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\\n', 'hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her\\n', \"mother's apartment, immediately met her.\\n\", '\\n', 'Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\\n', 'eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\\n', 'heard of the fugitives.\\n', '\\n', '\"Not yet,\" replied Jane. \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\\n', 'everything will be well.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Is my father in town?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say\\n', 'that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\\n', 'particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write\\n', 'again till he had something of importance to mention.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And my mother--how is she? How are you all?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\\n', 'shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\\n', 'all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\\n', 'Heaven, are quite well.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But you--how are you?\" cried Elizabeth. \"You look pale. How much you\\n', 'must have gone through!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\\n', 'conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\\n', 'engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach\\n', 'of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\\n', 'thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\\n', '\\n', 'When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\\n', 'had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\\n', 'found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of\\n', 'good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet\\n', 'deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\\n', 'every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\\n', 'to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\\n', '\\n', \"Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'\\n\", 'conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\\n', 'tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\\n', 'conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\\n', 'blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\\n', 'errors of her daughter must principally be owing.\\n', '\\n', '\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to Brighton,\\n', 'with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia\\n', 'had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\\n', 'of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\\n', 'side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been\\n', 'well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the\\n', 'charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!\\n', \"And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,\\n\", 'wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become\\n', 'of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his\\n', 'grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we\\n', 'shall do.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\\n', 'general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\\n', 'that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\\n', 'Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\\n', '\\n', '\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is right to be\\n', 'prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\\n', 'It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we\\n', 'may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\\n', 'and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\\n', 'lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make\\n', 'him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult\\n', 'together as to what is to be done.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly what I\\n', 'could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\\n', 'wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\\n', 'marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\\n', 'tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\\n', 'after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\\n', 'Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my\\n', 'wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such\\n', 'spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that\\n', 'I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to\\n', 'give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does\\n', 'not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I\\n', 'know you will contrive it all.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\\n', 'in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well\\n', 'in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till\\n', 'dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on\\n', 'the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\\n', '\\n', 'Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\\n', 'occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\\n', 'oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\\n', 'tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\\n', 'better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\\n', 'most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\\n', 'subject.\\n', '\\n', 'In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\\n', 'too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\\n', 'before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\\n', 'faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\\n', 'in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\\n', 'which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of\\n', 'fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\\n', 'mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\\n', 'of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\\n', '\\n', '\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\\n', 'But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\\n', 'each other the balm of sisterly consolation.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\\n', '\"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\\n', 'lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one\\n', 'false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less\\n', 'brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in\\n', 'her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed\\n', 'to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\\n', 'kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\\n', '\\n', 'In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\n', 'half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of\\n', 'the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to\\n', 'satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\\n', 'of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\\n', 'Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\\n', 'the subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which\\n', 'I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\\n', 'Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\\n', 'took place? They must have seen them together for ever.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\\n', \"especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\\n\", 'grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\\n', '_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\\n', 'any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\\n', 'first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\\n', 'their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\\n', 'their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\\n', 'repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am\\n', 'inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\\n', 'doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt\\n', \"a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him\\n\", 'in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\\n', 'right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\\n', 'imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\\n', \"triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter\\n\", 'she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\\n', 'being in love with each other, many weeks.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, I believe not.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does\\n', 'he know his real character?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\\n', 'did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad\\n', 'affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;\\n', 'but I hope this may be false.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\\n', 'this could not have happened!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister. \"But to expose\\n', 'the former faults of any person without knowing what their present\\n', 'feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.

Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself\\n', 'sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in\\n', 'your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because\\n', 'proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be\\n', 'wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that\\n', 'may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the\\n', \"most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would\\n\", 'have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to\\n', 'be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\\n', 'informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has\\n', 'proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,\\n', 'for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think\\n', 'that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be\\n', 'guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,\\n', 'you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined\\n', 'by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to\\n', 'whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that\\n', 'this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of\\n', 'all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,\\n', 'will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads\\n', 'me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event\\n', 'of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\\n', 'in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to\\n', 'console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child\\n', 'from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her\\n', 'own heinous offense.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am, dear sir, etc., etc.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from\\n', 'Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\\n', 'It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he\\n', 'kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one\\n', 'living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he\\n', 'had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of\\n', 'particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,\\n', 'who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the\\n', 'wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for\\n', \"secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for\\n\", 'it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a\\n', 'very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a\\n', 'thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\\n', 'He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\\n', 'formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars\\n', 'from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \"A gamester!\"\\n', 'she cried. \"This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their\\n', 'father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.

It would have spared her, she thought,\\n\", 'one sleepless night out of two.\\n', '\\n', 'When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\n', 'philosophic composure.

As\\n', \"soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon\\n\", 'married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\n', 'exuberance.

She was disturbed by no fear for her\\n', 'felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried. \"This is delightful indeed! She will\\n', 'be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!\\n', 'My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage\\n', 'everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\\n', 'clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\\n', 'them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him\\n', 'how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\\n', 'Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\\n', 'Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\\n', 'these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\\n', \"Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.\\n\", '\\n', '\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a great\\n', 'measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\\n', 'assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it but\\n', 'her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\\n', 'must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\\n', 'ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well!

My dear Jane, I am in\\n', \"such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and\\n\", 'you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money\\n', 'afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\\n', 'cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\\n', 'not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\\n', \"father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,\\n\", 'would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\\n', 'so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\n', '\\n', '\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\\n', 'good, good news to my sister Philips.

She felt it so; and though, in\\n', 'looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could\\n', 'be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had\\n', 'feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had\\n', 'gained.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 50\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,\\n', 'instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for\\n', 'the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\\n', 'him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\\n', 'respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever\\n', 'of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\\n', 'prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be\\n', 'her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\\n', '\\n', 'He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\\n', 'should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he\\n', 'was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\\n', 'and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\\n', '\\n', 'When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\\n', 'useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join\\n', 'in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\\n', 'and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\\n', 'successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\\n', \"Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he\\n\", 'would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then\\n', 'too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\\n', \"husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\\n\", 'income.\\n', '\\n', 'Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\\n', 'the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\\n', 'latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\\n', 'regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\\n', 'could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\\n', 'terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,\\n', 'though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\n', 'approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\n', 'engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\\n', 'that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would\\n', 'be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\\n', 'arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the\\n', 'hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\\n', 'allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\\n', \"through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within\\n\", 'that sum.\\n', '\\n', 'That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\\n', 'another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as\\n', 'little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\\n', 'of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\\n', 'naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\\n', 'dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick\\n', 'in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he\\n', 'was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any\\n', 'message to her.\\n', '\\n', 'The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate\\n', 'speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\\n', 'philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage\\n', 'of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\\n', 'happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant\\n', 'farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\\n', 'good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from\\n', 'all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit\\n', 'in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery\\n', 'was considered certain.\\n', '\\n', 'It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this\\n', 'happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\\n', 'spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\\n', 'triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object\\n', 'of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\\n', 'accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\\n', 'attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\\n', 'servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\\n', 'proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering\\n', 'what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\n', 'importance.\\n', '\\n', '\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--or the\\n', 'great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\\n', 'too far off!

But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: \"Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and\\n', 'daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\\n', 'neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\\n', 'impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It\\n', 'soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\\n', 'that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\\n', 'daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\\n', 'affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\\n', 'it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\n', 'resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her\\n', 'marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe\\n', 'possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new\\n', \"clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of\\n\", 'shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\\n', 'took place.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\\n', 'the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\\n', 'her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the\\n', 'proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\\n', 'unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\\n', 'spot.\\n', '\\n', 'She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were\\n', 'few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\\n', \"but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's\\n\", 'frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear\\n', 'of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,\\n', \"there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been\\n\", 'concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\\n', 'Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other\\n', 'objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the\\n', 'nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.\\n', '\\n', 'From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The\\n', 'wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\\n', 'feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\\n', 'blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\\n', 'hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\\n', 'longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\\n', 'seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\\n', 'she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\\n', 'should meet.\\n', '\\n', 'What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\\n', 'proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now\\n', 'have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\\n', 'doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,\\n', 'there must be a triumph.\\n', '\\n', 'She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\\n', 'disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\\n', 'temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\\n', 'was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease\\n', 'and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\\n', 'and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she\\n', 'must have received benefit of greater importance.\\n', '\\n', 'But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\\n', 'connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\\n', 'precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\\n', 'family.\\n', '\\n', 'How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,\\n', 'she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could\\n', 'belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions\\n', 'were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\\n', '\\n', '                          * * * * *\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's\\n\", 'acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to\\n', 'promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\\n', 'that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\\n', 'purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved\\n', 'on quitting the militia.\\n', '\\n', '\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as soon as\\n', 'his marriage was fixed on.

Their\\n', 'arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,\\n', 'who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she\\n', 'been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\\n', 'must endure.\\n', '\\n', 'They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive\\n', 'them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to\\n', 'the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\\n', 'anxious, uneasy.\\n', '\\n', \"Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\\n\", 'she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\\n', 'welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,\\n', 'to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an\\n', 'alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\\n', '\\n', 'Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\\n', 'so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\\n', 'opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\\n', 'enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet\\n', 'was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,\\n', 'and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their\\n', 'congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly\\n', 'round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\\n', 'observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\\n', 'there.\\n', '\\n', 'Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners\\n', 'were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been\\n', 'exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\\n', 'claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had\\n', 'not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,\\n', 'resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence\\n', 'of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the\\n', 'two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.\\n', '\\n', 'There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\\n', 'of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\\n', 'Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\\n', 'with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her\\n', 'replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\\n', 'world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\\n', 'voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\\n', 'the world.\\n', '\\n', '\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I went away;\\n', 'it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things\\n', 'enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\\n', 'I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\\n', 'thought it would be very good fun if I was.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked\\n', 'expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\\n', 'which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the\\n', 'people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;\\n', 'and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he\\n', 'should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took\\n', 'off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that\\n', 'he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;\\n', 'and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\\n', 'the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\\n', \"anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say\\n\", 'to her eldest sister, \"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\\n', 'lower, because I am a married woman.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\\n', 'from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\\n', 'spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and\\n', 'all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\"\\n', 'by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her\\n', 'ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast\\n', 'room, \"and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I\\n', 'am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half\\n', 'my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get\\n', 'husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\\'t\\n', 'at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\\n', 'things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.

Mr. Wickham\\n', 'had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\\n', 'his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\n', '\\n', 'No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\\n', 'she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\\n', 'having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\\n', 'all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\\n', 'think, than such as did not.\\n', '\\n', \"Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected\\n\", \"to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her\\n\", 'present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\\n', 'their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\\n', 'than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\\n', 'for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\\n', 'that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\n', 'if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\\n', 'of having a companion.\\n', '\\n', 'Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\\n', 'occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every\\n', 'thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on\\n', 'the first of September, than any body else in the country.\\n', '\\n', 'One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\\n', 'elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\\n', '\\n', '\"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You\\n', 'were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you\\n', 'curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too little said\\n', 'on the subject.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\\n', \"married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in\\n\", 'that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\\n', \"o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\\n\", 'were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\\n', 'such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to\\n', 'put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was\\n', 'my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as\\n', 'if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\\n', 'ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed\\n', 'to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\\n', 'be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\\n', \"were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\\n\", 'me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\\n', 'fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was\\n', 'rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so\\n', 'just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon\\n', 'business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once\\n', 'they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I\\n', 'did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\\n', 'were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he\\n', \"came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,\\n\", 'I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the\\n', 'wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious\\n', 'me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\\n', 'them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on the\\n', 'subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \"we will\\n', 'ask you no questions.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly tell you\\n', 'all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\n', '\\n', 'On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\\n', 'power, by running away.\\n', '\\n', 'But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least\\n', 'it was impossible not to try for information.

It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\\n\", 'where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\\n', 'Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\\n', 'brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\\n', 'placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.

Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several\\n', 'hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so\\n', 'dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.\\n', 'Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,\\n', 'and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,\\n', 'Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\\n', 'after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\n', 'them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\\n', \"himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to\\n\", 'make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide\\n', 'in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\\n', 'confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private\\n', 'actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He\\n', 'called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy\\n', 'an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_\\n', 'motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days\\n', 'in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to\\n', 'direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness\\n', 'of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.\\n', '\\n', '\"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\\n', 'governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause\\n', 'of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large\\n', 'house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\\n', 'lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with\\n', 'Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to\\n', 'town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\\n', 'wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and\\n', 'corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.\\n', 'Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\\n', 'she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up\\n', 'their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the\\n', 'wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and\\n', 'afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he\\n', 'acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful\\n', 'situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed\\n', 'on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But\\n', 'he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\\n', 'for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear\\n', 'of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\\n', 'other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,\\n', 'it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,\\n', 'in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never\\n', 'been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,\\n', 'on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and\\n', \"scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her\\n\", 'own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as\\n', 'to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He\\n', 'must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\\n', 'nothing to live on.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though\\n', 'Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able\\n', 'to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by\\n', 'marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still\\n', 'cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in\\n', 'some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely\\n', 'to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\n', '\\n', '\"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of\\n', 'course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be\\n', 'reasonable.\\n', '\\n', '\"Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to\\n', 'make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\\n', 'street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be\\n', 'seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was\\n', 'still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge\\n', 'your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your\\n', 'uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the\\n', 'departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next\\n', 'day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.\\n', '\\n', '\"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,\\n', 'and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.\\n', '\\n', '\"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all\\n', 'settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\\n', 'Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that\\n', 'obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been\\n', 'accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.\\n', 'Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and\\n', 'I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your\\n', 'uncle would most readily have settled the whole.\\n', '\\n', '\"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either\\n', 'the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle\\n', 'was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his\\n', 'niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\\n', 'which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter\\n', 'this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\\n', 'that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\\n', 'it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane\\n', 'at most.\\n', '\\n', '\"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young\\n', 'people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably\\n', 'more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own\\n', 'settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all\\n', 'this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It\\n', 'was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\\n', \"Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he\\n\", 'had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\\n', \"in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,\\n\", 'can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,\\n', 'my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would\\n', 'never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another\\n', 'interest_ in the affair.\\n', '\\n', '\"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who\\n', 'were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in\\n', 'London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were\\n', 'then to receive the last finish.\\n', '\\n', '\"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which\\n', 'you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not\\n', 'afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant\\n', 'admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I\\n', 'knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\\n', 'satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not\\n', \"perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming\\n\", 'home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell\\n', 'you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most\\n', 'serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\\n', 'done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she\\n', 'heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\\n', 'sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and\\n', 'Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\\n', 'attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave\\n', 'town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my\\n', 'dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\\n', 'enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,\\n', 'in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His\\n', 'understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little\\n', 'more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach\\n', 'him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But\\n', 'slyness seems the fashion.\\n', '\\n', '\"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\\n', 'punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy\\n', 'till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little\\n', 'pair of ponies, would be the very thing.\\n', '\\n', '\"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half\\n', 'hour.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yours, very sincerely,\\n', '\\n', '\"M. GARDINER.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\\n', 'in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\\n', 'greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\\n', \"produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's\\n\", 'match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too\\n', 'great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the\\n', 'pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!\\n', 'He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all\\n', 'the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which\\n', 'supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and\\n', 'despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason\\n', 'with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to\\n', 'avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had\\n', 'done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her\\n', 'heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\\n', 'checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity\\n', 'was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for\\n', 'a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so\\n', 'natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law\\n', 'of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,\\n', 'to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had\\n', 'given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary\\n', 'stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\\n', 'wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and\\n', 'though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she\\n', 'could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist\\n', 'his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially\\n', 'concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were\\n', 'under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They\\n', 'owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!\\n', 'how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever\\n', 'encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For\\n', 'herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause\\n', 'of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.\\n', \"She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It\\n\", 'was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some\\n', 'pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she\\n', 'and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted\\n', 'between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n', '\\n', \"She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's\\n\", 'approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was\\n', 'overtaken by Wickham.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\" said he,\\n', 'as he joined her.\\n', '\\n', '\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not follow\\n', 'that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and\\n', 'now we are better.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"True. Are the others coming out?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\\n', 'Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\\n', 'you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She replied in the affirmative.\\n', '\\n', '\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\\n', 'for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\\n', 'old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\\n', 'me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, she did.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And what did she say?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\\n', 'out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\\n', 'misrepresented.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\\n', 'silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\\n', '\\n', '\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\\n', 'several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\\n', 'Elizabeth. \"It must be something particular, to take him there at this\\n', 'time of year.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\\n', 'understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And do you like her?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very much.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\\n', 'or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\\n', 'you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A\\n', 'most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited\\n', 'me in every respect.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,\\n', 'and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to\\n', 'repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The\\n', 'quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas\\n', 'of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\\n', 'circumstance, when you were in Kent?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\\n', 'left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\\n', 'first, you may remember.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not\\n', 'so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\\n', 'declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\\n', 'had been compromised accordingly.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\\n', 'what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\\n', \"to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,\\n\", 'she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:\\n', '\\n', '\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let\\n', 'us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\\n', 'mind.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\\n', 'he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 53\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he\\n', 'never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\\n', 'by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\\n', 'had said enough to keep him quiet.\\n', '\\n', \"The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was\\n\", 'forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\\n', 'entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\\n', 'continue at least a twelvemonth.\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, lord! I don\\'t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\\n', 'writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\\n', 'do.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He\\n\", 'smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\n', '\\n', '\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\\n', 'the house, \"as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to\\n', 'us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\\n', 'himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\\n', '\\n', '\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as parting with\\n', 'one\\'s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\" said\\n', 'Elizabeth. \"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\\n', 'single.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,\\n', \"but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If\\n\", 'that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\"\\n', '\\n', 'But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\\n', 'relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\\n', 'article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\\n', 'at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\\n', 'master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\\n', 'weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\\n', 'smiled and shook her head by turns.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\" (for Mrs.\\n', 'Phillips first brought her the news). \"Well, so much the better. Not\\n', 'that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am\\n', 'sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome\\n', 'to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?\\n', 'But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to\\n', 'mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls was in\\n', 'Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\\n', 'to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He\\n', 'comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\\n', \"going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\\n\", 'Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\\n', 'colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\\n', 'Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:\\n', '\\n', '\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\\n', \"report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from\\n\", 'any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\\n', 'I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\\n', 'me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\\n', 'alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\\n', '_myself_, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\\n', 'Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\\n', 'other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\\n', 'to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\\n', \"there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\\n\", 'without it.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot\\n', 'come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this\\n', 'speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\\n', 'feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\\n', 'perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\\n', 'more unequal, than she had often seen them.\\n', '\\n', 'The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\\n', 'about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\n', '\\n', '\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"you\\n', 'will wait on him of course.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\\n', 'went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\\n', 'nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\\'s errand again.\"\\n', '\\n', 'His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\\n', 'would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\\n', 'Netherfield.\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our society,\\n', 'let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours\\n', 'in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\\n', 'again.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\\n', \"on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I\\n\", 'am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\\n', 'make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\\n', 'him.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\\n', \"husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\\n\", 'neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\\n', '_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\\n', '\\n', '\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her sister. \"It\\n', 'would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\\n', 'hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\\n', 'but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\\n', 'says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wish I could say anything to comfort you,\" replied Elizabeth; \"but it\\n', 'is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\\n', 'of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\\n', 'always so much.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\\n', 'contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\\n', 'and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted\\n', 'the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;\\n', 'hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his\\n', 'arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\\n', 'enter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\n', '\\n', 'Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\\n', 'kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\\n', 'to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\\n', 'again by her sister.\\n', '\\n', '\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it be?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\\n', 'know.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to be with\\n', 'him before. Mr. what\\'s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\\n', \"Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\\n\", 'say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\\n', 'of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\\n', 'which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\\n', 'after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\\n', 'enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\\n', 'mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\\n', \"civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either\\n\", 'of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\\n', 'suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\\n', \"Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\\n\", 'To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\\n', 'and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\n', 'information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\\n', 'for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\\n', 'interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as\\n', 'what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\\n', 'coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\\n', 'was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\\n', 'behaviour in Derbyshire.\\n', '\\n', 'The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\\n', 'minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\\n', 'her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\\n', 'wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\\n', '\\n', '\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early\\n', 'enough for expectation.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\\n', 'lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of\\n', 'her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\\n', 'paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\\n', \"gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\\n\", 'tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\\n', 'symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\\n', 'again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\\n', 'had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,\\n', 'she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\\n', \"she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\\n\", 'presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\\n', 'not an improbable, conjecture.\\n', '\\n', 'Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\\n', 'saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\\n', 'especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\\n', 'her curtsey and address to his friend.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter\\n', 'the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,\\n', 'was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\\n', 'applied.\\n', '\\n', 'Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question\\n', 'which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He\\n', 'was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\\n', 'it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,\\n', 'when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\\n', 'bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\\n', 'the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\\n', 'found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\\n', 'the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\\n', 'they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\\n', 'with herself for being so.\\n', '\\n', '\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\\n', '\\n', 'She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\\n', 'him she had hardly courage to speak.\\n', '\\n', 'She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\n', '\\n', 'He readily agreed to it.\\n', '\\n', '\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say\\n', 'you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\\n', 'it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\\n', 'since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\\n', 'own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\\n', 'seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;\\n', \"though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,\\n\", \"George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a\\n\", 'syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\\n', \"It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\\n\", 'make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\\n', 'dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\\n', 'not tell.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\"\\n', 'continued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\\n', 'hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\\n', 'Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay\\n', 'I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have\\n', 'heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\\n', 'regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so\\n', 'many as he deserves.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\\n', 'misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,\\n', 'however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\\n', 'done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in\\n', 'the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\\n', '\\n', '\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother,\\n', '\"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\\n', \"Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\\n\", 'will save all the best of the covies for you.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\\n\", 'attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had\\n', 'flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be\\n', 'hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt\\n', 'that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\\n', 'moments of such painful confusion.\\n', '\\n', '\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to\\n', 'be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\\n', 'that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\\n', 'one or the other again!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\n', 'compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\\n', 'how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\\n', 'former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\\n', 'but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He\\n', 'found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and\\n', 'as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\\n', 'difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\\n', 'that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,\\n', 'that she did not always know when she was silent.\\n', '\\n', 'When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\\n', 'intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\\n', 'Longbourn in a few days time.\\n', '\\n', '\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added, \"for when\\n', 'you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\\n', 'us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure\\n', 'you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep\\n', 'your engagement.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\\n', 'his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\\n', 'there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\\n', 'not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\\n', 'on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\\n', 'of one who had ten thousand a year.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 54\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\\n', 'or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that\\n', \"must deaden them more.

I will\\n', 'think no more about him.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\\n', 'of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her\\n', 'better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\\n', 'easy.

When they repaired to the\\n', 'dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\\n', 'the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\\n', 'her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore\\n', 'to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\\n', 'hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\\n', 'decided. He placed himself by her.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.\\n', 'He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\\n', 'Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\\n', 'likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\\n', 'alarm.\\n', '\\n', 'His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an\\n', 'admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\\n', \"Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his\\n\", 'own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\\n', 'consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\\n', 'gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\n', 'no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\\n', 'could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\\n', 'such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\\n', 'advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\\n', 'she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\\n', \"cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,\\n\", \"made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;\\n\", 'and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\\n', 'him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the\\n', 'family.\\n', '\\n', 'She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\\n', 'bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\\n', 'without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than\\n', 'the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious\\n', 'and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the\\n', 'gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her\\n', 'uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\\n', 'her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\n', '\\n', '\"If he does not come to me, _then_,\" said she, \"I shall give him up for\\n', 'ever.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\\n', 'answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\\n', 'where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\\n', 'in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her\\n', \"which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of\\n\", 'the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:\\n', '\\n', '\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\\n', 'do we?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\\n', 'her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\\n', 'to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for\\n', 'being so silly!\\n', '\\n', '\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\\n', 'expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not\\n', 'protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\\n', 'There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\\n', '\\n', 'She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup\\n', 'himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\\n', '\\n', '\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Mrs. Annesley is with her.

She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\\n', 'They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had\\n', 'nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\\n', 'of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\\n', 'supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\\n', 'others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \"What\\n', 'say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,\\n', 'I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\\n', 'venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so\\n', 'fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\\n', \"Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\\n\", 'were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\\n', 'cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\\n', 'beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\\n', \"what do you think she said besides? 'Ah!

I do think Mrs. Long is as good\\n\", 'a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\\n', 'and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of\\n', \"Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at\\n\", 'last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\\n', 'humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\\n', 'not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\\n', '\\n', '\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \"The\\n', 'party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\\n', 'may often meet again.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth smiled.\\n', '\\n', '\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.\\n', 'I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\\n', 'agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am\\n', 'perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\\n', 'any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed\\n', 'with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\\n', 'pleasing, than any other man.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me smile, and\\n', 'are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And how impossible in others!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\n', 'acknowledge?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.

His\\n', 'friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\\n', 'ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\\n', 'good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\\n', 'expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\n', '\\n', '\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more lucky.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would\\n', 'give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\\n', '\\n', '\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\\n', 'accepted with alacrity.\\n', '\\n', 'He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them\\n', \"dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing\\n\", 'gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\\n', 'come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\\n', 'Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\\n', 'Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is\\n', 'forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!\\n', 'Where is your sash, my dear?\"\\n', '\\n', 'But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\\n', 'without one of her sisters.\\n', '\\n', 'The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\\n', 'evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\\n', 'custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of\\n', 'the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\\n', 'Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\\n', 'impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\\n', 'Kitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma? What do\\n', 'you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then sat still\\n', 'five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\\n', 'suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here, my love, I want to\\n', 'speak to you,\" took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look\\n', 'at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her\\n', 'entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet half-opened the door and called out:\\n', '\\n', '\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was forced to go.\\n', '\\n', '\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her mother, as\\n', 'soon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in\\n', 'my dressing-room.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\\n', 'quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\\n', 'into the drawing-room.\\n', '\\n', \"Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every\\n\", 'thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His\\n', 'ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their\\n', 'evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the\\n', 'mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command\\n', 'of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\\n', '\\n', 'He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\\n', 'away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.\\n', \"Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\\n\", '\\n', 'After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\\n', 'between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in\\n', 'the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\\n', 'returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\\n', \"persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's\\n\", 'concurrence.\\n', '\\n', 'Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent\\n', 'the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\\n', 'agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\\n', 'or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\\n', 'silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\\n', 'other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\\n', \"and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get\\n\", 'every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\\n', 'to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\\n', 'for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\\n', \"wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.\\n\", '\\n', 'But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\\n', 'saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\\n', 'had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\\n', 'sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\\n', 'earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\\n', 'both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would\\n', 'have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she\\n', 'thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\\n', 'Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\\n', 'well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\\n', 'words to her sister, ran out of the room.\\n', '\\n', 'Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\\n', 'pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\\n', 'emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!\\n', 'why is not everybody as happy?\"\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,\\n\", 'a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\\n', 'kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\\n', 'allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\\n', 'said for the present.\\n', '\\n', '\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any\\n', 'account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\\n', 'from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to\\n', 'know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\\n', 'family! how shall I bear so much happiness!\"\\n', '\\n', 'She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\\n', 'card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\\n', 'with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\\n', 'previous months of suspense and vexation.\\n', '\\n', '\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious\\n', \"circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the\\n\", 'happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\n', '\\n', 'In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\\n', 'father had been short and to the purpose.\\n', '\\n', '\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\n', '\\n', '\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\"\\n', '\\n', 'He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\\n', 'and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed\\n', 'her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\\n', 'great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\\n', \"to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;\\n\", 'and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\\n', 'expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\\n', 'basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of\\n', 'Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\\n', 'himself.\\n', '\\n', 'It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\\n', \"Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\\n\", 'made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\\n', 'her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or\\n', 'speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\\n', 'though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when\\n', 'Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\\n', 'how really happy he was.\\n', '\\n', 'Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\\n', 'visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\\n', 'turned to his daughter, and said:\\n', '\\n', '\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\n', 'goodness.\\n', '\\n', '\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in\\n', 'thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\\n', 'doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\\n', 'each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\\n', 'easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\\n', 'always exceed your income.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\\n', 'unpardonable in me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife, \"what are you\\n', 'talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\\n', 'more.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so\\n', \"happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\\n\", 'would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\\n', 'be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\\n', 'he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\\n', 'that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\\n', 'ever was seen!\"\\n', '\\n', 'Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\\n', 'favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger\\n', 'sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\\n', 'which she might in future be able to dispense.\\n', '\\n', 'Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\\n', 'begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\n', '\\n', 'Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\\n', 'coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\\n', 'supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\\n', 'detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself\\n', 'obliged to accept.\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\\n', 'while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;\\n', 'but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours\\n', 'of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he\\n', 'always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\\n', 'her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\\n', 'relief.\\n', '\\n', '\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me that he\\n', 'was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\\n', 'it possible.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for\\n', 'it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing. They were certainly no friends to\\n', 'his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\\n', 'chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\\n', 'as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\\n', 'learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\\n', 'can never be what we once were to each other.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever\\n', 'heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\\n', 'the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\\n', 'he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being\\n', 'indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\\n', 'modesty.\"\\n', '\\n', 'This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\\n', 'the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased\\n', 'to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,\\n', 'though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she\\n', 'knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\n', '\\n', '\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\" cried\\n', 'Jane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\\n', 'above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy!

No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\\n', 'good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\\n', 'secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,\\n', 'and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\\n', 'neighbours in Meryton.\\n', '\\n', 'The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\\n', 'world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\\n', 'they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 56\\n', '\\n', '\\n', \"One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been\\n\", 'formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\\n', 'dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\\n', 'sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up\\n', 'the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\\n', 'equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\\n', 'were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\\n', 'preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\\n', 'somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\\n', 'the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\\n', 'shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\\n', 'continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\\n', 'open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\n', '\\n', 'They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\n', 'astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\\n', 'Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\\n', 'inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\n', '\\n', 'She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\\n', \"other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the\\n\", 'head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\\n', \"name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of\\n\", 'introduction had been made.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\\n', 'high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\\n', 'for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\\n', '\\n', '\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\\n', 'mother.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\n', '\\n', '\"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.\\n', '\"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\\n', 'and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man\\n', 'who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine after a short\\n', 'silence.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\\n', 'assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\\n', 'summer; the windows are full west.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then\\n', 'added:\\n', '\\n', '\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and\\n', 'Mrs. Collins well.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\\n', 'Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\\n', 'letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\\n', 'refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\\n', 'declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\\n', 'on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\\n', 'will favour me with your company.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and show her ladyship about the\\n', 'different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\\n', 'attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\\n', 'hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\\n', 'drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\\n', 'looking rooms, walked on.\\n', '\\n', 'Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\n', 'waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\\n', 'that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\\n', 'conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\\n', 'disagreeable.\\n', '\\n', '\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she looked in\\n', 'her face.\\n', '\\n', 'As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\\n', 'manner:--\\n', '\\n', '\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\\n', 'journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\\n', 'come.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\\n', 'for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to\\n', 'know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\\n', 'choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\\n', 'celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\\n', 'moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\\n', 'alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your\\n', 'sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\\n', 'you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon\\n', 'afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\\n', '_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\\n', 'so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved\\n', 'on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\\n', 'you.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring\\n', 'with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming\\n', 'so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth\\n', 'coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\\n', 'is in existence.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\\n', 'industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\\n', 'report is spread abroad?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I never heard that it was.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may\\n', 'ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\\n', 'he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\\n', 'reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\\n', 'have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\\n', 'may have drawn him in.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\\n', 'language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\\n', 'and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,\\n', 'ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\\n', 'presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\\n', 'engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\\n', 'make an offer to me.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\\n', '\\n', '\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\\n', 'they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\\n', '_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned\\n', 'the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\\n', 'be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\\n', 'inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\\n', 'the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\\n', 'tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\\n', 'propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest\\n', 'hours he was destined for his cousin?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is\\n', 'no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not\\n', 'be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to\\n', 'marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\\n', 'marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither\\n', 'by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\\n', 'another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,\\n', 'Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\\n', 'friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\\n', 'be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\\n', 'Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\\n', 'by any of us.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the wife of Mr.\\n', 'Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\\n', 'attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\\n', 'to repine.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\\n', 'for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\\n', 'score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\\n', 'here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will\\n', \"I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's\\n\", 'whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"_That_ will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more pitiable;\\n', 'but it will have no effect on me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\\n', 'nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\\n', \"side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,\\n\", 'honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on\\n', 'both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\\n', 'every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\\n', 'The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,\\n', 'or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you\\n', 'were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in\\n', 'which you have been brought up.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\\n', \"sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are\\n\", 'equal.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"True. You _are_ a gentleman\\'s daughter. But who was your mother?\\n', 'Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\\n', 'condition.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your nephew does\\n', 'not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\\n', 'Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\\n', \"moment's deliberation:\\n\", '\\n', '\"I am not.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Lady Catherine seemed pleased.\\n', '\\n', '\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\\n', 'reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that\\n', 'I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\\n', 'assurance I require.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\\n', 'anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\\n', 'your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their\\n', 'marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would\\n', 'my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\\n', 'Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have\\n', 'supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the\\n', 'application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if\\n', 'you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your\\n', 'nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;\\n', 'but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,\\n', 'therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\\n', 'objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am\\n', \"no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous\\n\", \"elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a\\n\", 'patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is\\n', \"such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his\\n\", \"late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are\\n\", 'you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You can now have nothing further to say,\" she resentfully answered.\\n', '\"You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to\\n', 'the house.\"\\n', '\\n', 'And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\\n', 'back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\n', '\\n', '\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\\n', 'Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\\n', 'must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\\n', 'which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\\n', 'reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\\n', 'claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\\n', 'the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth, \"have any\\n', 'possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\\n', 'would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\\n', 'resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\\n', \"_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's\\n\", 'concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\\n', 'the scorn.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.\\n', 'I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\\n', 'ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\\n', 'reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.\"\\n', '\\n', 'In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of\\n', 'the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, \"I take no leave\\n', 'of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve\\n', 'no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\\n', 'ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\\n', 'heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother\\n', 'impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady\\n', 'Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.\\n', '\\n', '\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\\n', 'civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were\\n', 'well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through\\n', 'Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\\n', 'nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to\\n', 'acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 57\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\\n', 'Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many\\n', 'hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\\n', 'appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,\\n', 'for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\\n', 'Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report\\n', 'of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\\n', 'till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\\n', 'and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\\n', 'expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\\n', 'the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\\n', 'sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours\\n', 'at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the\\n', 'Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had\\n', 'only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked\\n', 'forward to as possible at some future time.\\n', '\\n', \"In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help\\n\", 'feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\\n', 'in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\\n', 'prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\\n', 'an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar\\n', 'representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\\n', 'not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\\n', 'aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\n', 'that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\\n', 'was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,\\n', 'whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\\n', 'address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\\n', 'probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\\n', 'and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\n', '\\n', 'If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often\\n', 'seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\\n', 'settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\\n', 'unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\\n', 'Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\\n', 'Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\\n', '\\n', '\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\\n', 'friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall know how to understand\\n', 'it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\\n', 'constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\\n', 'have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\\n', 'at all.\"\\n', '\\n', '                          * * * * *\\n', '\\n', 'The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\\n', 'been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same\\n', \"kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and\\n\", 'Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\\n', '\\n', 'The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her\\n', 'father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\n', '\\n', '\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my room.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to\\n', 'tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\\n', 'connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it\\n', 'might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the\\n', 'consequent explanations.\\n', '\\n', 'She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He\\n', 'then said,\\n', '\\n', '\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\n', 'exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\\n', 'contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink\\n', 'of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\"\\n', '\\n', \"The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous\\n\", 'conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\\n', 'and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\\n', 'himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\\n', 'herself; when her father continued:\\n', '\\n', '\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\\n', 'as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the\\n', 'name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Something very much to the purpose of course.

I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says\\n', \"on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus\\n\", 'offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\n', 'this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;\\n', 'of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\\n', 'Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\\n', 'her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may\\n', 'be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in\\n', \"this land.'\\n\", '\\n', '\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? \\'This young\\n', 'gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of\\n', 'mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive\\n', 'patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin\\n', 'Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate\\n', \"closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be\\n\", \"inclined to take immediate advantage of.'\\n\", '\\n', '\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine\\n', 'that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with\\n', \"a friendly eye.'\\n\", '\\n', '\"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\\n', 'surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within\\n', 'the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie\\n', 'more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\\n', 'woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his\\n', 'life! It is admirable!\"\\n', '\\n', \"Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force\\n\", 'one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\\n', 'little agreeable to her.\\n', '\\n', '\"Are you not diverted?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\\n', 'night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\\n', 'felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\\n', 'family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\\n', 'consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty\\n', 'to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\\n', 'her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\\n', \"hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr.\\n\", \"Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad\\n\", 'business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\\n', 'living together before the marriage took place should be so generally\\n', 'known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\\n', 'from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\\n', 'couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\\n', 'encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\\n', 'very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,\\n', 'as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\\n', \"names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian\\n\", \"forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's\\n\", 'situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you\\n', 'look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,\\n', 'I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we\\n', 'live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\\n', 'turn?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is so\\n', 'strange!\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\\n', 'it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_\\n', 'pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\\n', \"writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any\\n\", 'consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\\n', 'him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\n', 'hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\\n', 'about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\"\\n', '\\n', 'To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\\n', 'been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by\\n', 'his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\\n', 'feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she\\n', 'would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by\\n', \"what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but\\n\", 'wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\\n', 'his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 58\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\\n', 'Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\\n', \"with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's\\n\", 'visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time\\n', 'to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat\\n', 'in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\\n', 'their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\n', 'habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five\\n', 'set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others\\n', 'to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\\n', 'were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty\\n', 'was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\\n', 'desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\n', '\\n', 'They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon\\n', 'Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\\n', 'when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the\\n', 'moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was\\n', 'high, she immediately said:\\n', '\\n', '\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving\\n', 'relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\\n', 'can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my\\n', 'poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to\\n', 'acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\\n', 'of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\\n', 'and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\\n', 'mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\\n', 'was so little to be trusted.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first betrayed to\\n', 'me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\\n', 'not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\\n', 'in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\\n', 'you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\\n', 'sake of discovering them.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"If you _will_ thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself alone.\\n', 'That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\\n', 'inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\\n', '_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\\n', 'only of _you_.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\\n', 'her companion added, \"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\\n', 'feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\\n', 'affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence\\n', 'me on this subject for ever.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\\n', 'his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\\n', 'very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\\n', 'so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make\\n', 'her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\\n', 'happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\\n', 'felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\\n', 'warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\\n', 'been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the\\n', 'expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;\\n', 'but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\\n', 'feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\\n', 'affection every moment more valuable.\\n', '\\n', 'They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\\n', 'be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\\n', 'soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\\n', 'to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through\\n', 'London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\\n', 'substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\\n', \"every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension,\\n\", 'peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that\\n', 'such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise\\n', 'from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\\n', 'ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\n', '\\n', '\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\\n', 'to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,\\n', 'had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\\n', 'acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know enough\\n', 'of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\\n', 'abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\\n', 'your relations.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\\n', 'accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my\\n', 'behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\\n', 'unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\\n', 'evening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,\\n', 'will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved\\n', 'in civility.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\\n', 'then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\\n', 'it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\\n', \"reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a\\n\", \"more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can\\n\", 'scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,\\n', 'I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\\n', 'impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\\n', 'a way.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\\n', 'feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\\n', 'forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\\n', 'way that would induce you to accept me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\\n', 'all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Darcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon make you\\n', 'think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\\n', 'contents?\"\\n', '\\n', 'She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her\\n', 'former prejudices had been removed.\\n', '\\n', '\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\\n', 'necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part\\n', 'especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the\\n', 'power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might\\n', 'justly make you hate me.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\\n', 'preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\\n', 'opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\\n', 'changed as that implies.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly\\n', 'calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\\n', 'dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\\n', 'adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\\n', 'of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now\\n', 'so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\\n', 'circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\\n', 'of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\\n', 'pleasure.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your\\n', 'retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\\n', 'arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\\n', 'innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude\\n', 'which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish\\n', 'being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I\\n', 'was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I\\n', 'was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\\n', 'Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt\\n', 'by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all\\n', 'that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught\\n', 'me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family\\n', 'circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least\\n', 'to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I\\n', 'was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been\\n', 'but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You\\n', 'taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,\\n', 'I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.\\n', 'You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman\\n', 'worthy of being pleased.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\\n', 'wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\\n', 'you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\\n', 'wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take\\n', 'a proper direction.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at\\n', 'Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\\n', 'My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\\n', 'confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to show you, by every civility in\\n', 'my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to\\n', 'obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\\n', 'see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\\n', 'introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an\\n', 'hour after I had seen you.\"\\n', '\\n', \"He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her\\n\", 'disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\\n', 'the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\\n', 'following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\\n', 'before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness\\n', 'there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\\n', 'comprehend.\\n', '\\n', 'She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\\n', 'each, to be dwelt on farther.\\n', '\\n', 'After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\\n', 'anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\\n', 'it was time to be at home.\\n', '\\n', '\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder which\\n', 'introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with\\n', 'their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\\n', 'it.\\n', '\\n', '\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '\"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\" And\\n', 'though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\\n', 'the case.\\n', '\\n', '\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I made a\\n', 'confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I\\n', 'told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\\n', 'affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\\n', 'the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\\n', 'mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\\n', 'to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\\n', 'unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\\n', 'friend.\\n', '\\n', '\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when you told him\\n', 'that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits\\n', 'which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\\n', 'him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\\n', 'prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\\n', 'his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess\\n', 'one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\\n', 'allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\\n', 'last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\\n', 'angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\\n', \"in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\\n\", 'now.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\\n', 'friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\\n', 'herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,\\n', 'and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness\\n', 'of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\\n', 'continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\\n', 'parted.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 59\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a question\\n', 'which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,\\n', 'and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to\\n', 'say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own\\n', 'knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\\n', 'else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\\n', '\\n', 'The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\\n', 'acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.\\n', 'Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\\n', 'and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\\n', 'than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\\n', 'there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt\\n', 'in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no\\n', 'one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\\n', 'dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\n', '\\n', 'At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\\n', \"from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\\n\", '\\n', '\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\\n', 'you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and\\n', 'I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am\\n', 'in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are\\n', 'engaged.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Jane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\\n', 'you dislike him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\\n', 'did not always love him so well as I do now.

Elizabeth again, and more\\n', 'seriously assured her of its truth.\\n', '\\n', '\"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\" cried\\n', 'Jane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you\\n', 'certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\\n', 'happy with him?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that\\n', 'we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,\\n', 'Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\\n', 'delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\\n', 'really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\\n', 'marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\\n', 'to do?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I\\n', 'tell you all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What do you mean?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\\n', 'afraid you will be angry.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let\\n', 'me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me\\n', 'how long you have loved him?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.\\n', 'But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\\n', 'at Pemberley.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\\n', 'desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances\\n', 'of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\\n', 'further to wish.\\n', '\\n', '\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as myself.\\n', 'I always had a value for him.

What shall we do with him?\\n', \"Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's\\n\", 'way.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\\n', 'was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\\n', 'epithet.\\n', '\\n', 'As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\\n', 'shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\\n', 'and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\\n', 'hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"to walk\\n', 'to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\\n', 'never seen the view.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but I am\\n', 'sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won\\'t it, Kitty?\" Kitty owned that\\n', 'she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see\\n', 'the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went\\n', 'up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:\\n', '\\n', '\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\\n', 'disagreeable man all to yourself.

So, do not put yourself to\\n', 'inconvenience.\"\\n', '\\n', \"During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be\\n\", 'asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the\\n', \"application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother\\n\", 'would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\\n', 'would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she\\n', 'were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\\n', 'was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit\\n', 'to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear\\n', 'the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\\n', 'disapprobation.\\n', '\\n', '                          * * * * *\\n', '\\n', 'In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\\n', 'Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\\n', \"extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to\\n\", 'be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,\\n', 'his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\\n', 'filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched\\n', 'reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\\n', 'looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\\n', 'he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\\n', 'pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he\\n', 'wants you in the library.\" She was gone directly.\\n', '\\n', 'Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\\n', '\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be\\n', 'accepting this man?

It would have spared her from\\n', 'explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\\n', 'but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\\n', 'of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\n', '\\n', '\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.

We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\\n', 'this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I love him.\\n', 'Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\\n', 'know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\\n', 'such terms.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He is the kind\\n', 'of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\\n', 'condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\\n', 'having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know\\n', 'your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\\n', 'respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked\\n', 'up to him as a superior.

And so, Darcy did every thing;\\n', \"made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him\\n\", 'his commission! So much the better.

He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\\n', 'listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\n', 'the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\\n', \"meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.

Elizabeth did all she could to shield\\n', 'him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep\\n', 'him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\\n', 'without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising\\n', 'from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it\\n', 'added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to\\n', 'the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing\\n', 'to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at\\n', 'Pemberley.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 61\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got\\n', 'rid of her two most deserving daughters.

He delighted in\\n', 'going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\\n', 'a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\\n', '_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\\n', 'sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\\n', 'to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\\n', 'of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\n', '\\n', 'Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\\n', 'her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\\n', 'known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a\\n', \"temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,\\n\", 'she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\\n', \"ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's\\n\", 'society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\\n', 'frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\\n', 'balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\\n', '\\n', 'Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\\n', \"drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite\\n\", 'unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\\n', 'she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\\n', \"longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,\\n\", 'it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\\n', 'much reluctance.\\n', '\\n', 'As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\\n', 'the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\\n', 'Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\\n', 'and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every\\n', 'thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\\n', 'to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received\\n', 'from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,\\n', 'if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this\\n', 'effect:\\n', '\\n', '\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\\n', '\\n', '\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear\\n', 'Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so\\n', 'rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.\\n', 'I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not\\n', 'think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.\\n', 'Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,\\n', 'do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yours, etc.\"\\n', '\\n', 'As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in\\n', 'her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\\n', 'Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\\n', 'of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she\\n', 'frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\\n', 'income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\\n', 'their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\\n', 'their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\\n', 'herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance\\n', 'towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\\n', 'restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\n', 'extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap\\n', 'situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for\\n', 'her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and\\n', 'in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\\n', 'reputation which her marriage had given her.\\n', '\\n', 'Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for\\n', \"Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was\\n\", 'occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself\\n', 'in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently\\n', \"staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he\\n\", 'proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\\n', '\\n', \"Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she\\n\", 'thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\\n', 'dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\\n', 'attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\\n', 'to Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', \"Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters\\n\", 'was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\\n', 'other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\\n', 'in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with\\n', 'an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of\\n', 'talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\\n', 'which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\\n', 'pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen\\n', \"in her way.

But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,\\n\", 'he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\\n', 'and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\n', 'resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\\n', 'to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait\\n', 'on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\\n', 'received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\\n', 'visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\n', '\\n', 'With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.\\n', 'Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever\\n', 'sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing\\n', 'her into

n     n     n    mr  bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr  bingley  he n    had always intended to visit him  though to the last always assuring n    his wife that he should not go  and till the evening after the visit was n    paid she had no knowledge of it  it was then disclosed in the following n    manner  observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat  he n    suddenly addressed her with  n     n     i hope mr  bingley will like it  lizzy   n     n     we are not in a way to know  what  mr  bingley likes   said her mother n    resentfully   since we are not to visit   n     n     but you forget  mamma   said elizabeth   that we shall meet him at the n    assemblies  and that mrs  long promised to introduce him   n     n     i do not believe mrs  long will do any such thing  she has two nieces n    of her own  she is a selfish  hypocritical woman  and i have no opinion n    of her   n     n     no more have i   said mr  bennet   and i am glad to find that you do n    not depend on her serving you   n     n    mrs  bennet deigned not to make any reply  but  unable to contain n    herself  began scolding one of her daughters  n     n     don  t keep coughing so  kitty  for heaven  s sake  have a little n    compassion on my nerves  you tear them to pieces   n     n     kitty has no discretion in her coughs   said her father   she times n    them ill   n     n     i do not cough for my own amusement   replied kitty fretfully   when is n    your next ball to be  lizzy   n     n     to-morrow fortnight   n     n     aye  so it is   cried her mother   and mrs  long does not come back n    till the day before  so it will be impossible for her to introduce him  n    for she will not know him herself   n     n     then  my dear  you may have the advantage of your friend  and introduce n    mr  bingley to  her    n     n     impossible  mr  bennet  impossible  when i am not acquainted with him n    myself  how can you be so teasing   n     n     i honour your circumspection  a fortnight  s acquaintance is certainly n    very little  one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a n    fortnight  but if  we  do not venture somebody else will  and after all  n    mrs  long and her neices must stand their chance  and  therefore  as n    she will think it an act of kindness  if you decline the office  i will n    take it on myself   n     n    the girls stared at their father  mrs  bennet said only   nonsense  n    nonsense   n     n     what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation   cried he   do n    you consider the forms of introduction  and the stress that is laid on n    them  as nonsense  i cannot quite agree with you  there   what say you  n    mary  for you are a young lady of deep reflection  i know  and read n    great books and make extracts   n     n    mary wished to say something sensible  but knew not how  n     n     while mary is adjusting her ideas   he continued   let us return to mr  n    bingley   n     n     i am sick of mr  bingley   cried his wife  n     n     i am sorry to hear  that   but why did not you tell me that before  if n    i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called n    on him  it is very unlucky  but as i have actually paid the visit  we n    cannot escape the acquaintance now   n     n    the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished  that of mrs  n    bennet perhaps surpassing the rest  though  when the first tumult of joy n    was over  she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the n    while  n     n     how good it was in you  my dear mr  bennet  but i knew i should n    persuade you at last  i was sure you loved your girls too well to n    neglect such an acquaintance  well  how pleased i am  and it is such a n    good joke  too  that you should have gone this morning and never said a n    word about it till now   n     n     now  kitty  you may cough as much as you choose   said mr  bennet  and  n    as he spoke  he left the room  fatigued with the raptures of his wife  n     n     what an excellent father you have  girls   said she  when the door was n    shut   i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness  n    or me  either  for that matter  at our time of life it is not so n    pleasant  i can tell you  to be making new acquaintances every day  but n    for your sakes  we would do anything  lydia  my love  though you  are  n    the youngest  i dare say mr  bingley will dance with you at the next n    ball   n     n     oh   said lydia stoutly   i am not afraid  for though i  am  the n    youngest  i  m the tallest   n     n    the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would n    return mr  bennet s visit  and determining when they should ask him to n    dinner  n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    not all that mrs  bennet  however  with the assistance of her five n    daughters  could ask on the subject  was sufficient to draw from her n    husband any satisfactory description of mr  bingley  they attacked him n    in various ways--with barefaced questions  ingenious suppositions  and n    distant surmises  but he eluded the skill of them all  and they were at n    last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour  n    lady lucas  her report was highly favourable  sir william had been n    delighted with him  he was quite young  wonderfully handsome  extremely n    agreeable  and  to crown the whole  he meant to be at the next assembly n    with a large party  nothing could be more delightful  to be fond of n    dancing was a certain step towards falling in love  and very lively n    hopes of mr  bingley s heart were entertained  n     n     if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield   n    said mrs  bennet to her husband   and all the others equally well n    married  i shall have nothing to wish for   n     n    in a few days mr  bingley returned mr  bennet s visit  and sat about n    ten minutes with him in his library  he had entertained hopes of being n    admitted to a sight of the young ladies  of whose beauty he had n    heard much  but he saw only the father  the ladies were somewhat more n    fortunate  for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper n    window that he wore a blue coat  and rode a black horse  n     n    an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched  and already n    had mrs  bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her n    housekeeping  when an answer arrived which deferred it all  mr  bingley n    was obliged to be in town the following day  and  consequently  unable n    to accept the honour of their invitation  etc  mrs  bennet was quite n    disconcerted  she could not imagine what business he could have in town n    so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire  and she began to fear that n    he might be always flying about from one place to another  and never n    settled at netherfield as he ought to be  lady lucas quieted her fears n    a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get n    a large party for the ball  and a report soon followed that mr  bingley n    was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly  n    the girls grieved over such a number of ladies  but were comforted the n    day before the ball by hearing  that instead of twelve he brought only n    six with him from london--his five sisters and a cousin  and when n    the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five n    altogether--mr  bingley  his two sisters  the husband of the eldest  and n    another young man  n     n    mr  bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike  he had a pleasant n    countenance  and easy  unaffected manners  his sisters were fine women  n    with an air of decided fashion  his brother-in-law  mr  hurst  merely n    looked the gentleman  but his friend mr  darcy soon drew the attention n    of the room by his fine  tall person  handsome features  noble mien  and n    the report which was in general circulation within five minutes n    after his entrance  of his having ten thousand a year  the gentlemen n    pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man  the ladies declared he n    was much handsomer than mr  bingley  and he was looked at with great n    admiration for about half the evening  till his manners gave a disgust n    which turned the tide of his popularity  for he was discovered to be n    proud  to be above his company  and above being pleased  and not all n    his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most n    forbidding  disagreeable countenance  and being unworthy to be compared n    with his friend  n     n    mr  bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal n    people in the room  he was lively and unreserved  danced every dance  n    was angry that the ball closed so early  and talked of giving n    one himself at netherfield  such amiable qualities must speak for n    themselves  what a contrast between him and his friend  mr  darcy danced n    only once with mrs  hurst and once with miss bingley  declined being n    introduced to any other lady  and spent the rest of the evening in n    walking about the room  speaking occasionally to one of his own party  n    his character was decided  he was the proudest  most disagreeable man n    in the world  and everybody hoped that he would never come there again  n    amongst the most violent against him was mrs  bennet  whose dislike of n    his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his n    having slighted one of her daughters  n     n    elizabeth bennet had been obliged  by the scarcity of gentlemen  to sit n    down for two dances  and during part of that time  mr  darcy had been n    standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr  n    bingley  who came from the dance for a few minutes  to press his friend n    to join it  n     n     come  darcy   said he   i must have you dance  i hate to see you n    standing about by yourself in this stupid manner  you had much better n    dance   n     n     i certainly shall not  you know how i detest it  unless i am n    particularly acquainted with my partner  at such an assembly as this n    it would be insupportable  your sisters are engaged  and there is not n    another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to n    stand up with   n     n     i would not be so fastidious as you are   cried mr  bingley   for a n    kingdom  upon my honour  i never met with so many pleasant girls in n    my life as i have this evening  and there are several of them you see n    uncommonly pretty   n     n      you  are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room   said mr  n    darcy  looking at the eldest miss bennet  n     n     oh  she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld  but there is one n    of her sisters sitting down just behind you  who is very pretty  and i n    dare say very agreeable  do let me ask my partner to introduce you   n     n     which do you mean   and turning round he looked for a moment at n    elizabeth  till catching her eye  he withdrew his own and coldly said  n     she is tolerable  but not handsome enough to tempt  me   i am in no n    humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted n    by other men  you had better return to your partner and enjoy her n    smiles  for you are wasting your time with me   n     n    mr  bingley followed his advice  mr  darcy walked off  and elizabeth n    remained with no very cordial feelings toward him  she told the story  n    however  with great spirit among her friends  for she had a lively  n    playful disposition  which delighted in anything ridiculous  n     n    the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family  mrs  n    bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield n    party  mr  bingley had danced with her twice  and she had been n    distinguished by his sisters  jane was as much gratified by this as n    her mother could be  though in a quieter way  elizabeth felt jane s n    pleasure  mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most n    accomplished girl in the neighbourhood  and catherine and lydia had been n    fortunate enough never to be without partners  which was all that they n    had yet learnt to care for at a ball  they returned  therefore  in good n    spirits to longbourn  the village where they lived  and of which they n    were the principal inhabitants  they found mr  bennet still up  with n    a book he was regardless of time  and on the present occasion he had a n    good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised n    such splendid expectations  he had rather hoped that his wife s views on n    the stranger would be disappointed  but he soon found out that he had a n    different story to hear  n     n     oh  my dear mr  bennet   as she entered the room   we have had a most n    delightful evening  a most excellent ball  i wish you had been there  n    jane was so admired  nothing could be like it  everybody said how well n    she looked  and mr  bingley thought her quite beautiful  and danced with n    her twice  only think of  that   my dear  he actually danced with her n    twice  and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second n    time  first of all  he asked miss lucas  i was so vexed to see him stand n    up with her  but  however  he did not admire her at all  indeed  nobody n    can  you know  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going n    down the dance  so he inquired who she was  and got introduced  and n    asked her for the two next  then the two third he danced with miss king  n    and the two fourth with maria lucas  and the two fifth with jane again  n    and the two sixth with lizzy  and the  boulanger --  n     n     if he had had any compassion for  me    cried her husband impatiently  n     he would not have danced half so much  for god  s sake  say no more of n    his partners  oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance   n     n     oh  my dear  i am quite delighted with him  he is so excessively n    handsome  and his sisters are charming women  i never in my life saw n    anything more elegant than their dresses  i dare say the lace upon mrs  n    hurst  s gown--  n     n    here she was interrupted again  mr  bennet protested against any n    description of finery  she was therefore obliged to seek another branch n    of the subject  and related  with much bitterness of spirit and some n    exaggeration  the shocking rudeness of mr  darcy  n     n     but i can assure you   she added   that lizzy does not lose much by not n    suiting  his  fancy  for he is a most disagreeable  horrid man  not at n    all worth pleasing  so high and so conceited that there was no enduring n    him  he walked here  and he walked there  fancying himself so very n    great  not handsome enough to dance with  i wish you had been there  my n    dear  to have given him one of your set-downs  i quite detest the man   n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    when jane and elizabeth were alone  the former  who had been cautious in n    her praise of mr  bingley before  expressed to her sister just how very n    much she admired him  n     n     he is just what a young man ought to be   said she   sensible  n    good-humoured  lively  and i never saw such happy manners --so much n    ease  with such perfect good breeding   n     n     he is also handsome   replied elizabeth   which a young man ought n    likewise to be  if he possibly can  his character is thereby complete   n     n     i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time  i n    did not expect such a compliment   n     n     did not you  i did for you  but that is one great difference between n    us  compliments always take  you  by surprise  and  me  never  what n    could be more natural than his asking you again  he could not help n    seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman n    in the room  no thanks to his gallantry for that  well  he certainly is n    very agreeable  and i give you leave to like him  you have liked many a n    stupider person   n     n     dear lizzy   n     n     oh  you are a great deal too apt  you know  to like people in general  n    you never see a fault in anybody  all the world are good and agreeable n    in your eyes  i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your n    life   n     n     i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone  but i always speak n    what i think   n     n     i know you do  and it is  that  which makes the wonder  with  your  n    good sense  to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of n    others  affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it n    everywhere  but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the n    good of everybody s character and make it still better  and say nothing n    of the bad--belongs to you alone  and so you like this man s sisters  n    too  do you  their manners are not equal to his   n     n     certainly not--at first  but they are very pleasing women when you n    converse with them  miss bingley is to live with her brother  and keep n    his house  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming n    neighbour in her   n     n    elizabeth listened in silence  but was not convinced  their behaviour at n    the assembly had not been calculated to please in general  and with more n    quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister  n    and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself  she n    was very little disposed to approve them  they were in fact very fine n    ladies  not deficient in good humour when they were pleased  nor in the n    power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it  but proud and n    conceited  they were rather handsome  had been educated in one of the n    first private seminaries in town  had a fortune of twenty thousand n    pounds  were in the habit of spending more than they ought  and of n    associating with people of rank  and were therefore in every respect n    entitled to think well of themselves  and meanly of others  they were of n    a respectable family in the north of england  a circumstance more deeply n    impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their n    own had been acquired by trade  n     n    mr  bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred n    thousand pounds from his father  who had intended to purchase an n    estate  but did not live to do it  mr  bingley intended it likewise  and n    sometimes made choice of his county  but as he was now provided with a n    good house and the liberty of a manor  it was doubtful to many of those n    who best knew the easiness of his temper  whether he might not spend the n    remainder of his days at netherfield  and leave the next generation to n    purchase  n     n    his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own  but  n    though he was now only established as a tenant  miss bingley was by no n    means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was mrs  hurst  who had n    married a man of more fashion than fortune  less disposed to consider n    his house as her home when it suited her  mr  bingley had not been of n    age two years  when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation n    to look at netherfield house  he did look at it  and into it for n    half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal n    rooms  satisfied with what the owner said in its praise  and took it n    immediately  n     n    between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship  in spite of n    great opposition of character  bingley was endeared to darcy by the n    easiness  openness  and ductility of his temper  though no disposition n    could offer a greater contrast to his own  and though with his own he n    never appeared dissatisfied  on the strength of darcy s regard  bingley n    had the firmest reliance  and of his judgement the highest opinion  n    in understanding  darcy was the superior  bingley was by no means n    deficient  but darcy was clever  he was at the same time haughty  n    reserved  and fastidious  and his manners  though well-bred  were not n    inviting  in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage  bingley n    was sure of being liked wherever he appeared  darcy was continually n    giving offense  n     n    the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently n    characteristic  bingley had never met with more pleasant people or n    prettier girls in his life  everybody had been most kind and attentive n    to him  there had been no formality  no stiffness  he had soon felt n    acquainted with all the room  and  as to miss bennet  he could not n    conceive an angel more beautiful  darcy  on the contrary  had seen a n    collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion  for n    none of whom he had felt the smallest interest  and from none received n    either attention or pleasure  miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty  n    but she smiled too much  n     n    mrs  hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired n    her and liked her  and pronounced her to be a sweet girl  and one n    whom they would not object to know more of  miss bennet was therefore n    established as a sweet girl  and their brother felt authorized by such n    commendation to think of her as he chose  n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets n    were particularly intimate  sir william lucas had been formerly in trade n    in meryton  where he had made a tolerable fortune  and risen to the n    honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty  n    the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly  it had given him a n    disgust to his business  and to his residence in a small market town  n    and  in quitting them both  he had removed with his family to a house n    about a mile from meryton  denominated from that period lucas lodge  n    where he could think with pleasure of his own importance  and  n    unshackled by business  occupy himself solely in being civil to all n    the world  for  though elated by his rank  it did not render him n    supercilious  on the contrary  he was all attention to everybody  by n    nature inoffensive  friendly  and obliging  his presentation at st  n    james s had made him courteous  n     n    lady lucas was a very good kind of woman  not too clever to be a n    valuable neighbour to mrs  bennet  they had several children  the eldest n    of them  a sensible  intelligent young woman  about twenty-seven  was n    elizabeth s intimate friend  n     n    that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over n    a ball was absolutely necessary  and the morning after the assembly n    brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate  n     n      you  began the evening well  charlotte   said mrs  bennet with civil n    self-command to miss lucas    you  were mr  bingley  s first choice   n     n     yes  but he seemed to like his second better   n     n     oh  you mean jane  i suppose  because he danced with her twice  to be n    sure that  did  seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he n     did --i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something n    about mr  robinson   n     n     perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr  robinson  did not n    i mention it to you  mr  robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton n    assemblies  and whether he did not think there were a great many n    pretty women in the room  and  which  he thought the prettiest  and his n    answering immediately to the last question   oh  the eldest miss bennet  n    beyond a doubt  there cannot be two opinions on that point     n     n     upon my word  well  that is very decided indeed--that does seem as n    if--but  however  it may all come to nothing  you know   n     n      my  overhearings were more to the purpose than  yours   eliza   said n    charlotte   mr  darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend  n    is he --poor eliza --to be only just  tolerable    n     n     i beg you would not put it into lizzy  s head to be vexed by his n    ill-treatment  for he is such a disagreeable man  that it would be quite n    a misfortune to be liked by him  mrs  long told me last night that he n    sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips   n     n     are you quite sure  ma  am --is not there a little mistake   said jane  n     i certainly saw mr  darcy speaking to her   n     n     aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield  and he n    could not help answering her  but she said he seemed quite angry at n    being spoke to   n     n     miss bingley told me   said jane   that he never speaks much  n    unless among his intimate acquaintances  with  them  he is remarkably n    agreeable   n     n     i do not believe a word of it  my dear  if he had been so very n    agreeable  he would have talked to mrs  long  but i can guess how it n    was  everybody says that he is eat up with pride  and i dare say he had n    heard somehow that mrs  long does not keep a carriage  and had come to n    the ball in a hack chaise   n     n     i do not mind his not talking to mrs  long   said miss lucas   but i n    wish he had danced with eliza   n     n     another time  lizzy   said her mother   i would not dance with  him   n    if i were you   n     n     i believe  ma  am  i may safely promise you  never  to dance with him   n     n     his pride   said miss lucas   does not offend  me  so much as pride n    often does  because there is an excuse for it  one cannot wonder that so n    very fine a young man  with family  fortune  everything in his favour  n    should think highly of himself  if i may so express it  he has a  right  n    to be proud   n     n     that is very true   replied elizabeth   and i could easily forgive n     his  pride  if he had not mortified  mine    n     n     pride   observed mary  who piqued herself upon the solidity of her n    reflections   is a very common failing  i believe  by all that i have n    ever read  i am convinced that it is very common indeed  that human n    nature is particularly prone to it  and that there are very few of us n    who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some n    quality or other  real or imaginary  vanity and pride are different n    things  though the words are often used synonymously  a person may n    be proud without being vain  pride relates more to our opinion of n    ourselves  vanity to what we would have others think of us   n     n     if i were as rich as mr  darcy   cried a young lucas  who came with n    his sisters   i should not care how proud i was  i would keep a pack of n    foxhounds  and drink a bottle of wine a day   n     n     then you would drink a great deal more than you ought   said mrs  n    bennet   and if i were to see you at it  i should take away your bottle n    directly   n     n    the boy protested that she should not  she continued to declare that she n    would  and the argument ended only with the visit  n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield  the visit n    was soon returned in due form  miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on n    the goodwill of mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and though the mother was n    found to be intolerable  and the younger sisters not worth speaking to  n    a wish of being better acquainted with  them  was expressed towards n    the two eldest  by jane  this attention was received with the greatest n    pleasure  but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment n    of everybody  hardly excepting even her sister  and could not like them  n    though their kindness to jane  such as it was  had a value as arising in n    all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration  it n    was generally evident whenever they met  that he  did  admire her and n    to  her  it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference n    which she had begun to entertain for him from the first  and was in a n    way to be very much in love  but she considered with pleasure that it n    was not likely to be discovered by the world in general  since jane n    united  with great strength of feeling  a composure of temper and a n    uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions n    of the impertinent  she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas  n     n     it may perhaps be pleasant   replied charlotte   to be able to impose n    on the public in such a case  but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be n    so very guarded  if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill n    from the object of it  she may lose the opportunity of fixing him  and n    it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in n    the dark  there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every n    attachment  that it is not safe to leave any to itself  we can all n     begin  freely--a slight preference is natural enough  but there are n    very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without n    encouragement  in nine cases out of ten a women had better show  more  n    affection than she feels  bingley likes your sister undoubtedly  but he n    may never do more than like her  if she does not help him on   n     n     but she does help him on  as much as her nature will allow  if i can n    perceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton  indeed  not to n    discover it too   n     n     remember  eliza  that he does not know jane  s disposition as you do   n     n     but if a woman is partial to a man  and does not endeavour to conceal n    it  he must find it out   n     n     perhaps he must  if he sees enough of her  but  though bingley and jane n    meet tolerably often  it is never for many hours together  and  as they n    always see each other in large mixed parties  it is impossible that n    every moment should be employed in conversing together  jane should n    therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his n    attention  when she is secure of him  there will be more leisure for n    falling in love as much as she chooses   n     n     your plan is a good one   replied elizabeth   where nothing is in n    question but the desire of being well married  and if i were determined n    to get a rich husband  or any husband  i dare say i should adopt it  but n    these are not jane s feelings  she is not acting by design  as yet  n    she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its n    reasonableness  she has known him only a fortnight  she danced four n    dances with him at meryton  she saw him one morning at his own house  n    and has since dined with him in company four times  this is not quite n    enough to make her understand his character   n     n     not as you represent it  had she merely  dined  with him  she might n    only have discovered whether he had a good appetite  but you must n    remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four n    evenings may do a great deal   n     n     yes  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they n    both like vingt-un better than commerce  but with respect to any other n    leading characteristic  i do not imagine that much has been unfolded   n     n     well   said charlotte   i wish jane success with all my heart  and n    if she were married to him to-morrow  i should think she had as good a n    chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a n    twelvemonth  happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance  if n    the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or n    ever so similar beforehand  it does not advance their felicity in the n    least  they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to n    have their share of vexation  and it is better to know as little as n    possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your n    life   n     n     you make me laugh  charlotte  but it is not sound  you know it is not n    sound  and that you would never act in this way yourself   n     n    occupied in observing mr  bingley s attentions to her sister  elizabeth n    was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some n    interest in the eyes of his friend  mr  darcy had at first scarcely n    allowed her to be pretty  he had looked at her without admiration at the n    ball  and when they next met  he looked at her only to criticise  but no n    sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly n    had a good feature in her face  than he began to find it was rendered n    uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes  to n    this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying  though he had n    detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry n    in her form  he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and n    pleasing  and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those n    of the fashionable world  he was caught by their easy playfulness  of n    this she was perfectly unaware  to her he was only the man who made n    himself agreeable nowhere  and who had not thought her handsome enough n    to dance with  n     n    he began to wish to know more of her  and as a step towards conversing n    with her himself  attended to her conversation with others  his doing so n    drew her notice  it was at sir william lucas s  where a large party were n    assembled  n     n     what does mr  darcy mean   said she to charlotte   by listening to my n    conversation with colonel forster   n     n     that is a question which mr  darcy only can answer   n     n     but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see n    what he is about  he has a very satirical eye  and if i do not begin by n    being impertinent myself  i shall soon grow afraid of him   n     n    on his approaching them soon afterwards  though without seeming to have n    any intention of speaking  miss lucas defied her friend to mention such n    a subject to him  which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it  she n    turned to him and said  n     n     did you not think  mr  darcy  that i expressed myself uncommonly n    well just now  when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at n    meryton   n     n     with great energy  but it is always a subject which makes a lady n    energetic   n     n     you are severe on us   n     n     it will be  her  turn soon to be teased   said miss lucas   i am going n    to open the instrument  eliza  and you know what follows   n     n     you are a very strange creature by way of a friend --always wanting me n    to play and sing before anybody and everybody  if my vanity had taken n    a musical turn  you would have been invaluable  but as it is  i would n    really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of n    hearing the very best performers   on miss lucas  s persevering  however  n    she added   very well  if it must be so  it must   and gravely glancing n    at mr  darcy   there is a fine old saying  which everybody here is of n    course familiar with   keep your breath to cool your porridge   and i n    shall keep mine to swell my song   n     n    her performance was pleasing  though by no means capital  after a song n    or two  and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that n    she would sing again  she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her n    sister mary  who having  in consequence of being the only plain one in n    the family  worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments  was always n    impatient for display  n     n    mary had neither genius nor taste  and though vanity had given her n    application  it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited n    manner  which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she n    had reached  elizabeth  easy and unaffected  had been listened to with n    much more pleasure  though not playing half so well  and mary  at the n    end of a long concerto  was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by n    scotch and irish airs  at the request of her younger sisters  who  n    with some of the lucases  and two or three officers  joined eagerly in n    dancing at one end of the room  n     n    mr  darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of n    passing the evening  to the exclusion of all conversation  and was too n    much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was n    his neighbour  till sir william thus began  n     n     what a charming amusement for young people this is  mr  darcy  there n    is nothing like dancing after all  i consider it as one of the first n    refinements of polished society   n     n     certainly  sir  and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst n    the less polished societies of the world  every savage can dance   n     n    sir william only smiled   your friend performs delightfully   he n    continued after a pause  on seeing bingley join the group   and i doubt n    not that you are an adept in the science yourself  mr  darcy   n     n     you saw me dance at meryton  i believe  sir   n     n     yes  indeed  and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight  do n    you often dance at st  james  s   n     n     never  sir   n     n     do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place   n     n     it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it   n     n     you have a house in town  i conclude   n     n    mr  darcy bowed  n     n     i had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for i am fond n    of superior society  but i did not feel quite certain that the air of n    london would agree with lady lucas   n     n    he paused in hopes of an answer  but his companion was not disposed n    to make any  and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them  he was n    struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing  and called out to n    her  n     n     my dear miss eliza  why are you not dancing  mr  darcy  you must allow n    me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner  you n    cannot refuse to dance  i am sure when so much beauty is before you   n    and  taking her hand  he would have given it to mr  darcy who  though n    extremely surprised  was not unwilling to receive it  when she instantly n    drew back  and said with some discomposure to sir william  n     n     indeed  sir  i have not the least intention of dancing  i entreat you n    not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner   n     n    mr  darcy  with grave propriety  requested to be allowed the honour of n    her hand  but in vain  elizabeth was determined  nor did sir william at n    all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion  n     n     you excel so much in the dance  miss eliza  that it is cruel to deny n    me the happiness of seeing you  and though this gentleman dislikes the n    amusement in general  he can have no objection  i am sure  to oblige us n    for one half-hour   n     n     mr  darcy is all politeness   said elizabeth  smiling  n     n     he is  indeed  but  considering the inducement  my dear miss eliza  n    we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a n    partner   n     n    elizabeth looked archly  and turned away  her resistance had not n    injured her with the gentleman  and he was thinking of her with some n    complacency  when thus accosted by miss bingley  n     n     i can guess the subject of your reverie   n     n     i should imagine not   n     n     you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings n    in this manner--in such society  and indeed i am quite of your opinion  n    i was never more annoyed  the insipidity  and yet the noise--the n    nothingness  and yet the self-importance of all those people  what would n    i give to hear your strictures on them   n     n     your conjecture is totally wrong  i assure you  my mind was more n    agreeably engaged  i have been meditating on the very great pleasure n    which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow   n     n    miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face  and desired he n    would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections  n    mr  darcy replied with great intrepidity  n     n     miss elizabeth bennet   n     n     miss elizabeth bennet   repeated miss bingley   i am all astonishment  n    how long has she been such a favourite --and pray  when am i to wish you n    joy   n     n     that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask  a lady  s n    imagination is very rapid  it jumps from admiration to love  from love n    to matrimony  in a moment  i knew you would be wishing me joy   n     n     nay  if you are serious about it  i shall consider the matter is n    absolutely settled  you will be having a charming mother-in-law  indeed  n    and  of course  she will always be at pemberley with you   n     n    he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to n    entertain herself in this manner  and as his composure convinced her n    that all was safe  her wit flowed long  n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    mr  bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two n    thousand a year  which  unfortunately for his daughters  was entailed  n    in default of heirs male  on a distant relation  and their mother s n    fortune  though ample for her situation in life  could but ill supply n    the deficiency of his  her father had been an attorney in meryton  and n    had left her four thousand pounds  n     n    she had a sister married to a mr  phillips  who had been a clerk to n    their father and succeeded him in the business  and a brother settled in n    london in a respectable line of trade  n     n    the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton  a most n    convenient distance for the young ladies  who were usually tempted n    thither three or four times a week  to pay their duty to their aunt and n    to a milliner s shop just over the way  the two youngest of the family  n    catherine and lydia  were particularly frequent in these attentions  n    their minds were more vacant than their sisters   and when nothing n    better offered  a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning n    hours and furnish conversation for the evening  and however bare of news n    the country in general might be  they always contrived to learn some n    from their aunt  at present  indeed  they were well supplied both with n    news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the n    neighbourhood  it was to remain the whole winter  and meryton was the n    headquarters  n     n    their visits to mrs  phillips were now productive of the most n    interesting intelligence  every day added something to their knowledge n    of the officers  names and connections  their lodgings were not long a n    secret  and at length they began to know the officers themselves  mr  n    phillips visited them all  and this opened to his nieces a store of n    felicity unknown before  they could talk of nothing but officers  and n    mr  bingley s large fortune  the mention of which gave animation n    to their mother  was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the n    regimentals of an ensign  n     n    after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject  mr  n    bennet coolly observed  n     n     from all that i can collect by your manner of talking  you must be two n    of the silliest girls in the country  i have suspected it some time  but n    i am now convinced   n     n    catherine was disconcerted  and made no answer  but lydia  with perfect n    indifference  continued to express her admiration of captain carter  n    and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day  as he was going the n    next morning to london  n     n     i am astonished  my dear   said mrs  bennet   that you should be so n    ready to think your own children silly  if i wished to think slightingly n    of anybody  s children  it should not be of my own  however   n     n     if my children are silly  i must hope to be always sensible of it   n     n     yes--but as it happens  they are all of them very clever   n     n     this is the only point  i flatter myself  on which we do not agree  i n    had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular  but i must n    so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly n    foolish   n     n     my dear mr  bennet  you must not expect such girls to have the sense of n    their father and mother  when they get to our age  i dare say they will n    not think about officers any more than we do  i remember the time when n    i liked a red coat myself very well--and  indeed  so i do still at my n    heart  and if a smart young colonel  with five or six thousand a year  n    should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him  and i thought n    colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in n    his regimentals   n     n     mamma   cried lydia   my aunt says that colonel forster and captain n    carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first n    came  she sees them now very often standing in clarke  s library   n     n    mrs  bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with n    a note for miss bennet  it came from netherfield  and the servant waited n    for an answer  mrs  bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure  and she was n    eagerly calling out  while her daughter read  n     n     well  jane  who is it from  what is it about  what does he say  well  n    jane  make haste and tell us  make haste  my love   n     n     it is from miss bingley   said jane  and then read it aloud  n     n     my dear friend -- n     n     if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me  n    we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives  n    for a whole day s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a n    quarrel  come as soon as you can on receipt of this  my brother and the n    gentlemen are to dine with the officers --yours ever  n     n     caroline bingley  n     n     with the officers   cried lydia   i wonder my aunt did not tell us of n     that    n     n     dining out   said mrs  bennet   that is very unlucky   n     n     can i have the carriage   said jane  n     n     no  my dear  you had better go on horseback  because it seems likely to n    rain  and then you must stay all night   n     n     that would be a good scheme   said elizabeth   if you were sure that n    they would not offer to send her home   n     n     oh  but the gentlemen will have mr  bingley  s chaise to go to meryton  n    and the hursts have no horses to theirs   n     n     i had much rather go in the coach   n     n     but  my dear  your father cannot spare the horses  i am sure  they are n    wanted in the farm  mr  bennet  are they not   n     n     they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them   n     n     but if you have got them to-day   said elizabeth   my mother  s purpose n    will be answered   n     n    she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses n    were engaged  jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback  and her n    mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a n    bad day  her hopes were answered  jane had not been gone long before n    it rained hard  her sisters were uneasy for her  but her mother was n    delighted  the rain continued the whole evening without intermission  n    jane certainly could not come back  n     n     this was a lucky idea of mine  indeed   said mrs  bennet more than n    once  as if the credit of making it rain were all her own  till the n    next morning  however  she was not aware of all the felicity of her n    contrivance  breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield n    brought the following note for elizabeth  n     n     my dearest lizzy -- n     n     i find myself very unwell this morning  which  i suppose  is to be n    imputed to my getting wet through yesterday  my kind friends will not n    hear of my returning till i am better  they insist also on my seeing mr  n    jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been n    to me--and  excepting a sore throat and headache  there is not much the n    matter with me --yours  etc   n     n     well  my dear   said mr  bennet  when elizabeth had read the note n    aloud   if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she n    should die  it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of n    mr  bingley  and under your orders   n     n     oh  i am not afraid of her dying  people do not die of little trifling n    colds  she will be taken good care of  as long as she stays there  it is n    all very well  i would go and see her if i could have the carriage   n     n    elizabeth  feeling really anxious  was determined to go to her  though n    the carriage was not to be had  and as she was no horsewoman  walking n    was her only alternative  she declared her resolution  n     n     how can you be so silly   cried her mother   as to think of such a n    thing  in all this dirt  you will not be fit to be seen when you get n    there   n     n     i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want   n     n     is this a hint to me  lizzy   said her father   to send for the n    horses   n     n     no  indeed  i do not wish to avoid the walk  the distance is nothing n    when one has a motive  only three miles  i shall be back by dinner   n     n     i admire the activity of your benevolence   observed mary   but every n    impulse of feeling should be guided by reason  and  in my opinion  n    exertion should always be in proportion to what is required   n     n     we will go as far as meryton with you   said catherine and lydia  n    elizabeth accepted their company  and the three young ladies set off n    together  n     n     if we make haste   said lydia  as they walked along   perhaps we may n    see something of captain carter before he goes   n     n    in meryton they parted  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one n    of the officers  wives  and elizabeth continued her walk alone  crossing n    field after field at a quick pace  jumping over stiles and springing n    over puddles with impatient activity  and finding herself at last n    within view of the house  with weary ankles  dirty stockings  and a face n    glowing with the warmth of exercise  n     n    she was shown into the breakfast-parlour  where all but jane were n    assembled  and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise  n    that she should have walked three miles so early in the day  in such n    dirty weather  and by herself  was almost incredible to mrs  hurst and n    miss bingley  and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt n    for it  she was received  however  very politely by them  and in their n    brother s manners there was something better than politeness  there n    was good humour and kindness  mr  darcy said very little  and mr  n    hurst nothing at all  the former was divided between admiration of the n    brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion  and doubt as n    to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone  the latter was n    thinking only of his breakfast  n     n    her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered  miss n    bennet had slept ill  and though up  was very feverish  and not n    well enough to leave her room  elizabeth was glad to be taken to her n    immediately  and jane  who had only been withheld by the fear of giving n    alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed n    for such a visit  was delighted at her entrance  she was not equal  n    however  to much conversation  and when miss bingley left them n    together  could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the n    extraordinary kindness she was treated with  elizabeth silently attended n    her  n     n    when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters  and elizabeth n    began to like them herself  when she saw how much affection and n    solicitude they showed for jane  the apothecary came  and having n    examined his patient  said  as might be supposed  that she had caught n    a violent cold  and that they must endeavour to get the better of it  n    advised her to return to bed  and promised her some draughts  the advice n    was followed readily  for the feverish symptoms increased  and her head n    ached acutely  elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment  nor were n    the other ladies often absent  the gentlemen being out  they had  in n    fact  nothing to do elsewhere  n     n    when the clock struck three  elizabeth felt that she must go  and very n    unwillingly said so  miss bingley offered her the carriage  and she only n    wanted a little pressing to accept it  when jane testified such concern n    in parting with her  that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer n    of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present  n    elizabeth most thankfully consented  and a servant was dispatched to n    longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply n    of clothes  n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress  and at half-past six n    elizabeth was summoned to dinner  to the civil inquiries which then n    poured in  and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the n    much superior solicitude of mr  bingley s  she could not make a very n    favourable answer  jane was by no means better  the sisters  on hearing n    this  repeated three or four times how much they were grieved  how n    shocking it was to have a bad cold  and how excessively they disliked n    being ill themselves  and then thought no more of the matter  and their n    indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored n    elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike  n     n    their brother  indeed  was the only one of the party whom she could n    regard with any complacency  his anxiety for jane was evident  and his n    attentions to herself most pleasing  and they prevented her feeling n    herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the n    others  she had very little notice from any but him  miss bingley was n    engrossed by mr  darcy  her sister scarcely less so  and as for mr  n    hurst  by whom elizabeth sat  he was an indolent man  who lived only to n    eat  drink  and play at cards  who  when he found her to prefer a plain n    dish to a ragout  had nothing to say to her  n     n    when dinner was over  she returned directly to jane  and miss bingley n    began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room  her manners were n    pronounced to be very bad indeed  a mixture of pride and impertinence  n    she had no conversation  no style  no beauty  mrs  hurst thought the n    same  and added  n     n     she has nothing  in short  to recommend her  but being an excellent n    walker  i shall never forget her appearance this morning  she really n    looked almost wild   n     n     she did  indeed  louisa  i could hardly keep my countenance  very n    nonsensical to come at all  why must  she  be scampering about the n    country  because her sister had a cold  her hair  so untidy  so blowsy   n     n     yes  and her petticoat  i hope you saw her petticoat  six inches deep n    in mud  i am absolutely certain  and the gown which had been let down to n    hide it not doing its office   n     n     your picture may be very exact  louisa   said bingley   but this was n    all lost upon me  i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably n    well when she came into the room this morning  her dirty petticoat quite n    escaped my notice   n     n      you  observed it  mr  darcy  i am sure   said miss bingley   and i am n    inclined to think that you would not wish to see  your  sister make such n    an exhibition   n     n     certainly not   n     n     to walk three miles  or four miles  or five miles  or whatever it is  n    above her ankles in dirt  and alone  quite alone  what could she mean by n    it  it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence  n    a most country-town indifference to decorum   n     n     it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing   said n    bingley  n     n     i am afraid  mr  darcy   observed miss bingley in a half whisper   that n    this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes   n     n     not at all   he replied   they were brightened by the exercise   a n    short pause followed this speech  and mrs  hurst began again  n     n     i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet  she is really a very n    sweet girl  and i wish with all my heart she were well settled  but with n    such a father and mother  and such low connections  i am afraid there is n    no chance of it   n     n     i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in n    meryton   n     n     yes  and they have another  who lives somewhere near cheapside   n     n     that is capital   added her sister  and they both laughed heartily  n     n     if they had uncles enough to fill  all  cheapside   cried bingley   it n    would not make them one jot less agreeable   n     n     but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any n    consideration in the world   replied darcy  n     n    to this speech bingley made no answer  but his sisters gave it their n    hearty assent  and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of n    their dear friend s vulgar relations  n     n    with a renewal of tenderness  however  they returned to her room on n    leaving the dining-parlour  and sat with her till summoned to coffee  n    she was still very poorly  and elizabeth would not quit her at all  till n    late in the evening  when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep  and n    when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go n    downstairs herself  on entering the drawing-room she found the whole n    party at loo  and was immediately invited to join them  but suspecting n    them to be playing high she declined it  and making her sister the n    excuse  said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay n    below  with a book  mr  hurst looked at her with astonishment  n     n     do you prefer reading to cards   said he   that is rather singular   n     n     miss eliza bennet   said miss bingley   despises cards  she is a great n    reader  and has no pleasure in anything else   n     n     i deserve neither such praise nor such censure   cried elizabeth   i am n     not  a great reader  and i have pleasure in many things   n     n     in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure   said bingley   and n    i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well   n     n    elizabeth thanked him from her heart  and then walked towards the n    table where a few books were lying  he immediately offered to fetch her n    others--all that his library afforded  n     n     and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own n    credit  but i am an idle fellow  and though i have not many  i have more n    than i ever looked into   n     n    elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those n    in the room  n     n     i am astonished   said miss bingley   that my father should have left n    so small a collection of books  what a delightful library you have at n    pemberley  mr  darcy   n     n     it ought to be good   he replied   it has been the work of many n    generations   n     n     and then you have added so much to it yourself  you are always buying n    books   n     n     i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as n    these   n     n     neglect  i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of n    that noble place  charles  when you build  your  house  i wish it may be n    half as delightful as pemberley   n     n     i wish it may   n     n     but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that n    neighbourhood  and take pemberley for a kind of model  there is not a n    finer county in england than derbyshire   n     n     with all my heart  i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it   n     n     i am talking of possibilities  charles   n     n     upon my word  caroline  i should think it more possible to get n    pemberley by purchase than by imitation   n     n    elizabeth was so much caught with what passed  as to leave her very n    little attention for her book  and soon laying it wholly aside  she drew n    near the card-table  and stationed herself between mr  bingley and his n    eldest sister  to observe the game  n     n     is miss darcy much grown since the spring   said miss bingley   will n    she be as tall as i am   n     n     i think she will  she is now about miss elizabeth bennet  s height  or n    rather taller   n     n     how i long to see her again  i never met with anybody who delighted me n    so much  such a countenance  such manners  and so extremely accomplished n    for her age  her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite   n     n     it is amazing to me   said bingley   how young ladies can have patience n    to be so very accomplished as they all are   n     n     all young ladies accomplished  my dear charles  what do you mean   n     n     yes  all of them  i think  they all paint tables  cover screens  and n    net purses  i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this  and i am sure n    i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time  without being n    informed that she was very accomplished   n     n     your list of the common extent of accomplishments   said darcy   has n    too much truth  the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no n    otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen  but i am very n    far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general  i n    cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen  in the whole range of my n    acquaintance  that are really accomplished   n     n     nor i  i am sure   said miss bingley  n     n     then   observed elizabeth   you must comprehend a great deal in your n    idea of an accomplished woman   n     n     yes  i do comprehend a great deal in it   n     n     oh  certainly   cried his faithful assistant   no one can be really n    esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met n    with  a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music  singing  drawing  n    dancing  and the modern languages  to deserve the word  and besides n    all this  she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of n    walking  the tone of her voice  her address and expressions  or the word n    will be but half-deserved   n     n     all this she must possess   added darcy   and to all this she must n    yet add something more substantial  in the improvement of her mind by n    extensive reading   n     n     i am no longer surprised at your knowing  only  six accomplished women  n    i rather wonder now at your knowing  any    n     n     are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all n    this   n     n     i never saw such a woman  i never saw such capacity  and taste  and n    application  and elegance  as you describe united   n     n    mrs  hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her n    implied doubt  and were both protesting that they knew many women who n    answered this description  when mr  hurst called them to order  with n    bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward  as all n    conversation was thereby at an end  elizabeth soon afterwards left the n    room  n     n     elizabeth bennet   said miss bingley  when the door was closed on her  n     is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the n    other sex by undervaluing their own  and with many men  i dare say  it n    succeeds  but  in my opinion  it is a paltry device  a very mean art   n     n     undoubtedly   replied darcy  to whom this remark was chiefly addressed  n     there is a meanness in  all  the arts which ladies sometimes condescend n    to employ for captivation  whatever bears affinity to cunning is n    despicable   n     n    miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to n    continue the subject  n     n    elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse  and n    that she could not leave her  bingley urged mr  jones being sent for n    immediately  while his sisters  convinced that no country advice could n    be of any service  recommended an express to town for one of the most n    eminent physicians  this she would not hear of  but she was not so n    unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal  and it was settled n    that mr  jones should be sent for early in the morning  if miss bennet n    were not decidedly better  bingley was quite uncomfortable  his sisters n    declared that they were miserable  they solaced their wretchedness  n    however  by duets after supper  while he could find no better relief n    to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every n    attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister  n     n     n     n    chapter  n     n     n    elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room  and in the n    morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the n    inquiries which she very early received from mr  bingley by a housemaid  n    and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his n    sisters  in spite of this amendment  however  she requested to have a n    note sent to longbourn  desiring her mother to visit jane  and form her n    own judgement of her situation  the note was immediately dispatched  and n    its contents as quickly complied with  mrs  bennet  accompanied by her n    two youngest girls  reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast  n     n    had she found jane in any apparent danger  mrs  bennet would have been n    very miserable  but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was n    not alarming  she had no wish of her recovering immediately  as her n    restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield  she n    would not listen  therefore  to her daughter s proposal of being carried n    home  neither did the apothecary  who arrived about the same time  think n    it at all advisable  after sitting a little while with jane  on miss n    bingley s appearance and invitation  the mother and three daughters all n    attended her into the breakfast parlour  bingley met them with hopes n    that mrs  bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected  n     n     indeed i have  sir   was her answer   she is a great deal too ill to be n    moved  mr  jones says we must not think of moving her  we must trespass n    a little longer on your kindness   n     n     removed   cried bingley   it must not be thought of  my sister  i am n    sure  will not hear of her removal   n     n     you may depend upon it  madam   said miss bingley  with cold civility  n     that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she n    remains with us   n     n    mrs  bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments  n     n     i am sure   she added   if it was not for such good friends i do not n    know what would become of her  for she is very ill indeed  and suffers n    a vast deal  though with the greatest patience in the world  which is n    always the way with her  for she has  without exception  the sweetest n    temper i have ever met with  i often tell my other girls they are n    nothing to  her   you have a sweet room here  mr  bingley  and a n    charming prospect over the gravel walk  i do not know a place in the n    country that is equal to netherfield  you will not think of quitting it n    in a hurry  i hope  though you have but a short lease   n     n     whatever i do is done in a hurry   replied he   and therefore if i n    should resolve to quit netherfield  i should probably be off in five n    minutes  at present  however  i consider myself as quite fixed here   n     n     that is exactly what i should have supposed of you   said elizabeth  n     n     you begin to comprehend me  do you   cried he  turning towards her  n     n     oh  yes--i understand you perfectly   n     n     i wish i might take this for a compliment  but to be so easily seen n    through i am afraid is pitiful   n     n     that is as it happens  it does not follow that a deep  intricate n    character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours   n     n     lizzy   cried her mother   remember where you are  and do not run on in n    the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home   n     n     i did not know before   continued bingley immediately   that you were a n    studier of character  it must be an amusing study   n     n     yes  but intricate characters are the  most  amusing  they have at n    least that advantage   n     n     the country   said darcy   can in general supply but a few subjects for n    such a study  in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and n    unvarying society   n     n     but people themselves alter so much  that there is something new to be n    observed in them for ever   n     n     yes  indeed   cried mrs  bennet  offended by his manner of mentioning n    a country neighbourhood   i assure you there is quite as much of  that  n    going on in the country as in town   n     n    everybody was surprised  and darcy  after looking at her for a moment  n    turned silently away  mrs  bennet  who fancied she had gained a complete n    victory over him  continued her triumph  n     n     i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country  for n    my part  except the shops and public places  the country is a vast deal n    pleasanter  is it not  mr  bingley   n     n     when i am in the country   he replied   i never wish to leave it  n    and when i am in town it is pretty much the same  they have each their n    advantages  and i can be equally happy in either   n     n     aye--that is because you have the right disposition  but that n    gentleman   looking at darcy   seemed to think the country was nothing n    at all   n     n     indeed  mamma  you are mistaken   said elizabeth  blushing for her n    mother   you quite mistook mr  darcy  he only meant that there was not n    such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town  n    which you must acknowledge to be true   n     n     certainly  my dear  nobody said there were  but as to not meeting n    with many people in this neighbourhood  i believe there are few n    neighbourhoods larger  i know we dine with four-and-twenty families   n     n    nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his n    countenance  his sister was less delicate  and directed her eyes towards n    mr  darcy with a very expressive smile  elizabeth  for the sake of n    saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts  now asked her if n    charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since  her  coming away  n     n     yes  she called yesterday with her father  what an agreeable man sir n    william is  mr  bingley  is not he  so much the man of fashion  so n    genteel and easy  he has always something to say to everybody   that  n    is my idea of good breeding  and those persons who fancy themselves very n    important  and never open their mouths  quite mistake the matter   n     n     did charlotte dine with you   n     n     no  she would go home  i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies  for n    my part  mr  bingley  i always keep servants that can do their own work  n     my  daughters are brought up very differently  but everybody is to n    judge for themselves  and the lucases are a very good sort of girls  n    i assure you  it is a pity they are not handsome  not that i think n    charlotte so  very  plain--but then she is our particular friend   n     n     she seems a very pleasant young woman   n     n     oh  dear  yes  but you must own she is very plain  lady lucas herself n    has often said so  and envied me jane s beauty  i do not like to boast n    of my own child  but to be sure  jane--one does not often see anybody n    better looking  it is what everybody says  i do not trust my own n    partiality  when she was only fifteen  there was a man at my brother n    gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was n    sure he would make her an offer before we came away  but  however  he n    did not  perhaps he thought her too young  however  he wrote some verses n    on her  and very pretty they were   n     n     and so ended his affection   said elizabeth impatiently   there has n    been many a one  i fancy  overcome in the same way  i wonder who first n    discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love   n     n     i have been used to consider poetry as the  food  of love   said darcy  n     n     of a fine  stout  healthy love it may  everything nourishes what is n    strong already  but if it be only a slight  thin sort of inclination  i n    am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away   n     n    darcy only smiled  and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth n    tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again  she longed to n    speak  but could think of nothing to say  and after a short silence mrs  n    bennet began repeating her thanks to mr  bingley for his kindness to n    jane  with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy  mr  bingley was n    unaffectedly civil in his answer  and forced his younger sister to be n    civil also  and say what the occasion required  she performed her part n    indeed without much graciousness  but mrs  bennet was satisfied  and n    soon afterwards ordered her carriage  upon this signal  the youngest of n    her daughters put herself forward  the two girls had been whispering to n    each other during the whole visit  and the result of it was  that the n    youngest should tax mr  bingley with having promised on his first coming n    into the country to give a ball at netherfield  n     n    lydia was a stout  well-grown girl of fifteen  with a fine complexion n    and good-humoured countenance  a favourite with her mother  whose n    affection had brought her into public at an early age  she had high n    animal spirits  and a sort of natural self-consequence  which the n    attention of the officers  to whom her uncle s good dinners  and her own n    easy manners recommended her  had increased into assurance  she was very n    equal  therefore  to address mr  bingley on the subject of the ball  and n    abruptly reminded him of his promise  adding  that it would be the most n    shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it  his answer to this n    sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear  n     n     i am perfectly ready  i assure you  to keep my engagement  and when n    your sister is recovered  you shall  if you please  name the very day of n    the ball  but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill   n     n    lydia declared herself satisfied   oh  yes--it would be much better to n    wait till jane was well  and by that time most likely captain carter n    would be at meryton again  and when you have given  your  ball   she n    added   i shall insist on their giving one also  i shall tell colonel n    forster it will be quite a shame if he does not   n     n    mrs  bennet and her daughters then departed  and elizabeth returned n    instantly to jane  leaving her own and her relations  behaviour to the n    remarks of the two ladies and mr  darcy  the latter of whom  however  n    could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of  her   in spite of n    all miss bingley s witticisms on  fine eyes   n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    the day passed much as the day before had done  mrs  hurst and miss n    bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid  who n    continued  though slowly  to mend  and in the evening elizabeth joined n    their party in the drawing-room  the loo-table  however  did not appear  n    mr  darcy was writing  and miss bingley  seated near him  was watching n    the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by n    messages to his sister  mr  hurst and mr  bingley were at piquet  and n    mrs  hurst was observing their game  n     n    elizabeth took up some needlework  and was sufficiently amused in n    attending to what passed between darcy and his companion  the perpetual n    commendations of the lady  either on his handwriting  or on the evenness n    of his lines  or on the length of his letter  with the perfect unconcern n    with which her praises were received  formed a curious dialogue  and was n    exactly in union with her opinion of each  n     n     how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter   n     n    he made no answer  n     n     you write uncommonly fast   n     n     you are mistaken  i write rather slowly   n     n     how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a n    year  letters of business  too  how odious i should think them   n     n     it is fortunate  then  that they fall to my lot instead of yours   n     n     pray tell your sister that i long to see her   n     n     i have already told her so once  by your desire   n     n     i am afraid you do not like your pen  let me mend it for you  i mend n    pens remarkably well   n     n     thank you--but i always mend my own   n     n     how can you contrive to write so even   n     n    he was silent  n     n     tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp  n    and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful n    little design for a table  and i think it infinitely superior to miss n    grantley  s   n     n     will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again  at n    present i have not room to do them justice   n     n     oh  it is of no consequence  i shall see her in january  but do you n    always write such charming long letters to her  mr  darcy   n     n     they are generally long  but whether always charming it is not for me n    to determine   n     n     it is a rule with me  that a person who can write a long letter with n    ease  cannot write ill   n     n     that will not do for a compliment to darcy  caroline   cried her n    brother   because he does  not  write with ease  he studies too much for n    words of four syllables  do not you  darcy   n     n     my style of writing is very different from yours   n     n     oh   cried miss bingley   charles writes in the most careless way n    imaginable  he leaves out half his words  and blots the rest   n     n     my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which n    means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents   n     n     your humility  mr  bingley   said elizabeth   must disarm reproof   n     n     nothing is more deceitful   said darcy   than the appearance of n    humility  it is often only carelessness of opinion  and sometimes an n    indirect boast   n     n     and which of the two do you call  my  little recent piece of modesty   n     n     the indirect boast  for you are really proud of your defects in n    writing  because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of n    thought and carelessness of execution  which  if not estimable  you n    think at least highly interesting  the power of doing anything with n    quickness is always prized much by the possessor  and often without any n    attention to the imperfection of the performance  when you told mrs  n    bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield n    you should be gone in five minutes  you meant it to be a sort of n    panegyric  of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very n    laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business n    undone  and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else   n     n     nay   cried bingley   this is too much  to remember at night all the n    foolish things that were said in the morning  and yet  upon my honour  n    i believe what i said of myself to be true  and i believe it at this n    moment  at least  therefore  i did not assume the character of needless n    precipitance merely to show off before the ladies   n     n     i dare say you believed it  but i am by no means convinced that n    you would be gone with such celerity  your conduct would be quite as n    dependent on chance as that of any man i know  and if  as you were n    mounting your horse  a friend were to say   bingley  you had better n    stay till next week   you would probably do it  you would probably not n    go--and at another word  might stay a month   n     n     you have only proved by this   cried elizabeth   that mr  bingley did n    not do justice to his own disposition  you have shown him off now much n    more than he did himself   n     n     i am exceedingly gratified   said bingley   by your converting what my n    friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper  but i am n    afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means n    intend  for he would certainly think better of me  if under such a n    circumstance i were to give a flat denial  and ride off as fast as i n    could   n     n     would mr  darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions n    as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it   n     n     upon my word  i cannot exactly explain the matter  darcy must speak for n    himself   n     n     you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine  n    but which i have never acknowledged  allowing the case  however  to n    stand according to your representation  you must remember  miss bennet  n    that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house  and n    the delay of his plan  has merely desired it  asked it without offering n    one argument in favour of its propriety   n     n     to yield readily--easily--to the  persuasion  of a friend is no merit n    with you   n     n     to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of n    either   n     n     you appear to me  mr  darcy  to allow nothing for the influence of n    friendship and affection  a regard for the requester would often make n    one readily yield to a request  without waiting for arguments to reason n    one into it  i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have n    supposed about mr  bingley  we may as well wait  perhaps  till the n    circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour n    thereupon  but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend  n    where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no n    very great moment  should you think ill of that person for complying n    with the desire  without waiting to be argued into it   n     n     will it not be advisable  before we proceed on this subject  to n    arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to n    appertain to this request  as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting n    between the parties   n     n     by all means   cried bingley   let us hear all the particulars  not n    forgetting their comparative height and size  for that will have more n    weight in the argument  miss bennet  than you may be aware of  i assure n    you  that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow  in comparison with n    myself  i should not pay him half so much deference  i declare i do not n    know a more awful object than darcy  on particular occasions  and in n    particular places  at his own house especially  and of a sunday evening  n    when he has nothing to do   n     n    mr  darcy smiled  but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was n    rather offended  and therefore checked her laugh  miss bingley warmly n    resented the indignity he had received  in an expostulation with her n    brother for talking such nonsense  n     n     i see your design  bingley   said his friend   you dislike an argument  n    and want to silence this   n     n     perhaps i do  arguments are too much like disputes  if you and miss n    bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room  i shall be very n    thankful  and then you may say whatever you like of me   n     n     what you ask   said elizabeth   is no sacrifice on my side  and mr  n    darcy had much better finish his letter   n     n    mr  darcy took her advice  and did finish his letter  n     n    when that business was over  he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth n    for an indulgence of some music  miss bingley moved with some alacrity n    to the pianoforte  and  after a polite request that elizabeth would lead n    the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived  she n    seated herself  n     n    mrs  hurst sang with her sister  and while they were thus employed  n    elizabeth could not help observing  as she turned over some music-books n    that lay on the instrument  how frequently mr  darcy s eyes were fixed n    on her  she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of n    admiration to so great a man  and yet that he should look at her n    because he disliked her  was still more strange  she could only imagine  n    however  at last that she drew his notice because there was something n    more wrong and reprehensible  according to his ideas of right  than in n    any other person present  the supposition did not pain her  she liked n    him too little to care for his approbation  n     n    after playing some italian songs  miss bingley varied the charm by n    a lively scotch air  and soon afterwards mr  darcy  drawing near n    elizabeth  said to her  n     n     do not you feel a great inclination  miss bennet  to seize such an n    opportunity of dancing a reel   n     n    she smiled  but made no answer  he repeated the question  with some n    surprise at her silence  n     n     oh   said she   i heard you before  but i could not immediately n    determine what to say in reply  you wanted me  i know  to say  yes   n    that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste  but i always n    delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes  and cheating a person of n    their premeditated contempt  i have  therefore  made up my mind to tell n    you  that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if n    you dare   n     n     indeed i do not dare   n     n    elizabeth  having rather expected to affront him  was amazed at his n    gallantry  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her n    manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody  and darcy n    had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her  he really n    believed  that were it not for the inferiority of her connections  he n    should be in some danger  n     n    miss bingley saw  or suspected enough to be jealous  and her great n    anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some n    assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth  n     n    she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest  by talking of n    their supposed marriage  and planning his happiness in such an alliance  n     n     i hope   said she  as they were walking together in the shrubbery n    the next day   you will give your mother-in-law a few hints  when this n    desirable event takes place  as to the advantage of holding her tongue  n    and if you can compass it  do cure the younger girls of running after n    officers  and  if i may mention so delicate a subject  endeavour to n    check that little something  bordering on conceit and impertinence  n    which your lady possesses   n     n     have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity   n     n     oh  yes  do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed n    in the gallery at pemberley  put them next to your great-uncle the n    judge  they are in the same profession  you know  only in different n    lines  as for your elizabeth s picture  you must not have it taken  for n    what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes   n     n     it would not be easy  indeed  to catch their expression  but their n    colour and shape  and the eyelashes  so remarkably fine  might be n    copied   n     n    at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs  hurst and n    elizabeth herself  n     n     i did not know that you intended to walk   said miss bingley  in some n    confusion  lest they had been overheard  n     n     you used us abominably ill   answered mrs  hurst   running away without n    telling us that you were coming out   n     n    then taking the disengaged arm of mr  darcy  she left elizabeth to walk n    by herself  the path just admitted three  mr  darcy felt their rudeness  n    and immediately said  n     n     this walk is not wide enough for our party  we had better go into the n    avenue   n     n    but elizabeth  who had not the least inclination to remain with them  n    laughingly answered  n     n     no  no  stay where you are  you are charmingly grouped  and appear n    to uncommon advantage  the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a n    fourth  good-bye   n     n    she then ran gaily off  rejoicing as she rambled about  in the hope of n    being at home again in a day or two  jane was already so much recovered n    as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    when the ladies removed after dinner  elizabeth ran up to her n    sister  and seeing her well guarded from cold  attended her into the n    drawing-room  where she was welcomed by her two friends with many n    professions of pleasure  and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable n    as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared  n    their powers of conversation were considerable  they could describe an n    entertainment with accuracy  relate an anecdote with humour  and laugh n    at their acquaintance with spirit  n     n    but when the gentlemen entered  jane was no longer the first object  n    miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned toward darcy  and she had n    something to say to him before he had advanced many steps  he addressed n    himself to miss bennet  with a polite congratulation  mr  hurst also n    made her a slight bow  and said he was  very glad   but diffuseness n    and warmth remained for bingley s salutation  he was full of joy and n    attention  the first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire  lest she n    should suffer from the change of room  and she removed at his desire n    to the other side of the fireplace  that she might be further from n    the door  he then sat down by her  and talked scarcely to anyone n    else  elizabeth  at work in the opposite corner  saw it all with great n    delight  n     n    when tea was over  mr  hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the n    card-table--but in vain  she had obtained private intelligence that mr  n    darcy did not wish for cards  and mr  hurst soon found even his open n    petition rejected  she assured him that no one intended to play  and n    the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her  mr  n    hurst had therefore nothing to do  but to stretch himself on one of the n    sofas and go to sleep  darcy took up a book  miss bingley did the same  n    and mrs  hurst  principally occupied in playing with her bracelets n    and rings  joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss n    bennet  n     n    miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr  n    darcy s progress through  his  book  as in reading her own  and she n    was perpetually either making some inquiry  or looking at his page  she n    could not win him  however  to any conversation  he merely answered her n    question  and read on  at length  quite exhausted by the attempt to be n    amused with her own book  which she had only chosen because it was the n    second volume of his  she gave a great yawn and said   how pleasant n    it is to spend an evening in this way  i declare after all there is no n    enjoyment like reading  how much sooner one tires of anything than of a n    book  when i have a house of my own  i shall be miserable if i have not n    an excellent library   n     n    no one made any reply  she then yawned again  threw aside her book  and n    cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement  when hearing n    her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet  she turned suddenly n    towards him and said  n     n     by the bye  charles  are you really serious in meditating a dance at n    netherfield  i would advise you  before you determine on it  to consult n    the wishes of the present party  i am much mistaken if there are n    not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a n    pleasure   n     n     if you mean darcy   cried her brother   he may go to bed  if he n    chooses  before it begins--but as for the ball  it is quite a settled n    thing  and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough  i shall send n    round my cards   n     n     i should like balls infinitely better   she replied   if they were n    carried on in a different manner  but there is something insufferably n    tedious in the usual process of such a meeting  it would surely be much n    more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of n    the day   n     n     much more rational  my dear caroline  i dare say  but it would not be n    near so much like a ball   n     n    miss bingley made no answer  and soon afterwards she got up and walked n    about the room  her figure was elegant  and she walked well  but n    darcy  at whom it was all aimed  was still inflexibly studious  in n    the desperation of her feelings  she resolved on one effort more  and  n    turning to elizabeth  said  n     n     miss eliza bennet  let me persuade you to follow my example  and take a n    turn about the room  i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so n    long in one attitude   n     n    elizabeth was surprised  but agreed to it immediately  miss bingley n    succeeded no less in the real object of her civility  mr  darcy looked n    up  he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as n    elizabeth herself could be  and unconsciously closed his book  he was n    directly invited to join their party  but he declined it  observing that n    he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down n    the room together  with either of which motives his joining them would n    interfere   what could he mean  she was dying to know what could be his n    meaning  --and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him  n     n     not at all   was her answer   but depend upon it  he means to be severe n    on us  and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing n    about it   n     n    miss bingley  however  was incapable of disappointing mr  darcy in n    anything  and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his n    two motives  n     n     i have not the smallest objection to explaining them   said he  as soon n    as she allowed him to speak   you either choose this method of passing n    the evening because you are in each other s confidence  and have secret n    affairs to discuss  or because you are conscious that your figures n    appear to the greatest advantage in walking  if the first  i would be n    completely in your way  and if the second  i can admire you much better n    as i sit by the fire   n     n     oh  shocking   cried miss bingley   i never heard anything so n    abominable  how shall we punish him for such a speech   n     n     nothing so easy  if you have but the inclination   said elizabeth   we n    can all plague and punish one another  tease him--laugh at him  intimate n    as you are  you must know how it is to be done   n     n     but upon my honour  i do  not   i do assure you that my intimacy has n    not yet taught me  that   tease calmness of manner and presence of n    mind  no  no  i feel he may defy us there  and as to laughter  we will n    not expose ourselves  if you please  by attempting to laugh without a n    subject  mr  darcy may hug himself   n     n     mr  darcy is not to be laughed at   cried elizabeth   that is an n    uncommon advantage  and uncommon i hope it will continue  for it would n    be a great loss to  me  to have many such acquaintances  i dearly love a n    laugh   n     n     miss bingley   said he   has given me more credit than can be  n    the wisest and the best of men--nay  the wisest and best of their n    actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in n    life is a joke   n     n     certainly   replied elizabeth-- there are such people  but i hope i n    am not one of  them   i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good  n    follies and nonsense  whims and inconsistencies   do  divert me  i own  n    and i laugh at them whenever i can  but these  i suppose  are precisely n    what you are without   n     n     perhaps that is not possible for anyone  but it has been the study n    of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong n    understanding to ridicule   n     n     such as vanity and pride   n     n     yes  vanity is a weakness indeed  but pride--where there is a real n    superiority of mind  pride will be always under good regulation   n     n    elizabeth turned away to hide a smile  n     n     your examination of mr  darcy is over  i presume   said miss bingley  n     and pray what is the result   n     n     i am perfectly convinced by it that mr  darcy has no defect  he owns it n    himself without disguise   n     n     no   said darcy   i have made no such pretension  i have faults enough  n    but they are not  i hope  of understanding  my temper i dare not vouch n    for  it is  i believe  too little yielding--certainly too little for the n    convenience of the world  i cannot forget the follies and vices of others n    so soon as i ought  nor their offenses against myself  my feelings n    are not puffed about with every attempt to move them  my temper n    would perhaps be called resentful  my good opinion once lost  is lost n    forever   n     n      that  is a failing indeed   cried elizabeth   implacable resentment n     is  a shade in a character  but you have chosen your fault well  i n    really cannot  laugh  at it  you are safe from me   n     n     there is  i believe  in every disposition a tendency to some particular n    evil--a natural defect  which not even the best education can overcome   n     n     and  your  defect is to hate everybody   n     n     and yours   he replied with a smile   is willfully to misunderstand n    them   n     n     do let us have a little music   cried miss bingley  tired of a n    conversation in which she had no share   louisa  you will not mind my n    waking mr  hurst   n     n    her sister had not the smallest objection  and the pianoforte was n    opened  and darcy  after a few moments  recollection  was not sorry for n    it  he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    in consequence of an agreement between the sisters  elizabeth wrote the n    next morning to their mother  to beg that the carriage might be sent for n    them in the course of the day  but mrs  bennet  who had calculated on n    her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday  which n    would exactly finish jane s week  could not bring herself to receive n    them with pleasure before  her answer  therefore  was not propitious  at n    least not to elizabeth s wishes  for she was impatient to get home  mrs  n    bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage n    before tuesday  and in her postscript it was added  that if mr  bingley n    and his sister pressed them to stay longer  she could spare them n    very well  against staying longer  however  elizabeth was positively n    resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked  and fearful  on the n    contrary  as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long  n    she urged jane to borrow mr  bingley s carriage immediately  and at n    length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield n    that morning should be mentioned  and the request made  n     n    the communication excited many professions of concern  and enough was n    said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work n    on jane  and till the morrow their going was deferred  miss bingley was n    then sorry that she had proposed the delay  for her jealousy and dislike n    of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other  n     n    the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so n    soon  and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be n    safe for her--that she was not enough recovered  but jane was firm where n    she felt herself to be right  n     n    to mr  darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at n    netherfield long enough  she attracted him more than he liked--and miss n    bingley was uncivil to  her   and more teasing than usual to himself  n    he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration n    should  now  escape him  nothing that could elevate her with the hope n    of influencing his felicity  sensible that if such an idea had been n    suggested  his behaviour during the last day must have material weight n    in confirming or crushing it  steady to his purpose  he scarcely spoke n    ten words to her through the whole of saturday  and though they were n    at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour  he adhered most n    conscientiously to his book  and would not even look at her  n     n    on sunday  after morning service  the separation  so agreeable to almost n    all  took place  miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last n    very rapidly  as well as her affection for jane  and when they parted  n    after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her n    to see her either at longbourn or netherfield  and embracing her most n    tenderly  she even shook hands with the former  elizabeth took leave of n    the whole party in the liveliest of spirits  n     n    they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother  mrs  bennet n    wondered at their coming  and thought them very wrong to give so much n    trouble  and was sure jane would have caught cold again  but their n    father  though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure  was really n    glad to see them  he had felt their importance in the family circle  the n    evening conversation  when they were all assembled  had lost much of n    its animation  and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and n    elizabeth  n     n    they found mary  as usual  deep in the study of thorough-bass and human n    nature  and had some extracts to admire  and some new observations of n    threadbare morality to listen to  catherine and lydia had information n    for them of a different sort  much had been done and much had been said n    in the regiment since the preceding wednesday  several of the officers n    had dined lately with their uncle  a private had been flogged  and it n    had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n     i hope  my dear   said mr  bennet to his wife  as they were at n    breakfast the next morning   that you have ordered a good dinner to-day  n    because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party   n     n     who do you mean  my dear  i know of nobody that is coming  i am sure  n    unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in--and i hope  my  dinners n    are good enough for her  i do not believe she often sees such at home   n     n     the person of whom i speak is a gentleman  and a stranger   n     n    mrs  bennet  s eyes sparkled   a gentleman and a stranger  it is mr  n    bingley  i am sure  well  i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr  n    bingley  but--good lord  how unlucky  there is not a bit of fish to be n    got to-day  lydia  my love  ring the bell--i must speak to hill this n    moment   n     n     it is  not  mr  bingley   said her husband   it is a person whom i n    never saw in the whole course of my life   n     n    this roused a general astonishment  and he had the pleasure of being n    eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once  n     n    after amusing himself some time with their curiosity  he thus explained  n     n     about a month ago i received this letter  and about a fortnight ago n    i answered it  for i thought it a case of some delicacy  and requiring n    early attention  it is from my cousin  mr  collins  who  when i am dead  n    may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases   n     n     oh  my dear   cried his wife   i cannot bear to hear that mentioned  n    pray do not talk of that odious man  i do think it is the hardest thing n    in the world  that your estate should be entailed away from your own n    children  and i am sure  if i had been you  i should have tried long ago n    to do something or other about it   n     n    jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail  they n    had often attempted to do it before  but it was a subject on which n    mrs  bennet was beyond the reach of reason  and she continued to rail n    bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of n    five daughters  in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about  n     n     it certainly is a most iniquitous affair   said mr  bennet   and n    nothing can clear mr  collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn  n    but if you will listen to his letter  you may perhaps be a little n    softened by his manner of expressing himself   n     n     no  that i am sure i shall not  and i think it is very impertinent of n    him to write to you at all  and very hypocritical  i hate such false n    friends  why could he not keep on quarreling with you  as his father did n    before him   n     n     why  indeed  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that n    head  as you will hear   n     n     hunsford  near westerham  kent    th october  n     n     dear sir -- n     n     the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured n    father always gave me much uneasiness  and since i have had the n    misfortune to lose him  i have frequently wished to heal the breach  but n    for some time i was kept back by my own doubts  fearing lest it might n    seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone n    with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance -- there  mrs  n    bennet  --my mind  however  is now made up on the subject  for having n    received ordination at easter  i have been so fortunate as to be n    distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de n    bourgh  widow of sir lewis de bourgh  whose bounty and beneficence has n    preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish  where it shall be n    my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her n    ladyship  and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which n    are instituted by the church of england  as a clergyman  moreover  i n    feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in n    all families within the reach of my influence  and on these grounds i n    flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable  and n    that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate n    will be kindly overlooked on your side  and not lead you to reject the n    offered olive-branch  i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the n    means of injuring your amiable daughters  and beg leave to apologise for n    it  as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible n    amends--but of this hereafter  if you should have no objection to n    receive me into your house  i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting n    on you and your family  monday  november   th  by four o clock  and n    shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se ennight n    following  which i can do without any inconvenience  as lady catherine n    is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday  provided n    that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day --i n    remain  dear sir  with respectful compliments to your lady and n    daughters  your well-wisher and friend  n     n     william collins  n     n     at four o  clock  therefore  we may expect this peace-making gentleman   n    said mr  bennet  as he folded up the letter   he seems to be a most n    conscientious and polite young man  upon my word  and i doubt not will n    prove a valuable acquaintance  especially if lady catherine should be so n    indulgent as to let him come to us again   n     n     there is some sense in what he says about the girls  however  and if n    he is disposed to make them any amends  i shall not be the person to n    discourage him   n     n     though it is difficult   said jane   to guess in what way he can mean n    to make us the atonement he thinks our due  the wish is certainly to his n    credit   n     n    elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady n    catherine  and his kind intention of christening  marrying  and burying n    his parishioners whenever it were required  n     n     he must be an oddity  i think   said she   i cannot make him n    out --there is something very pompous in his style --and what can he n    mean by apologising for being next in the entail --we cannot suppose he n    would help it if he could --could he be a sensible man  sir   n     n     no  my dear  i think not  i have great hopes of finding him quite the n    reverse  there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his n    letter  which promises well  i am impatient to see him   n     n     in point of composition   said mary   the letter does not seem n    defective  the idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new  yet i n    think it is well expressed   n     n    to catherine and lydia  neither the letter nor its writer were in any n    degree interesting  it was next to impossible that their cousin should n    come in a scarlet coat  and it was now some weeks since they had n    received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour  as for n    their mother  mr  collins s letter had done away much of her ill-will  n    and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which n    astonished her husband and daughters  n     n    mr  collins was punctual to his time  and was received with great n    politeness by the whole family  mr  bennet indeed said little  but the n    ladies were ready enough to talk  and mr  collins seemed neither in n    need of encouragement  nor inclined to be silent himself  he was a n    tall  heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty  his air was grave and n    stately  and his manners were very formal  he had not been long seated n    before he complimented mrs  bennet on having so fine a family of n    daughters  said he had heard much of their beauty  but that in this n    instance fame had fallen short of the truth  and added  that he did n    not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage  this n    gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers  but mrs  n    bennet  who quarreled with no compliments  answered most readily  n     n     you are very kind  i am sure  and i wish with all my heart it may n    prove so  for else they will be destitute enough  things are settled so n    oddly   n     n     you allude  perhaps  to the entail of this estate   n     n     ah  sir  i do indeed  it is a grievous affair to my poor girls  you n    must confess  not that i mean to find fault with  you   for such things n    i know are all chance in this world  there is no knowing how estates n    will go when once they come to be entailed   n     n     i am very sensible  madam  of the hardship to my fair cousins  and n    could say much on the subject  but that i am cautious of appearing n    forward and precipitate  but i can assure the young ladies that i come n    prepared to admire them  at present i will not say more  but  perhaps  n    when we are better acquainted--  n     n    he was interrupted by a summons to dinner  and the girls smiled on each n    other  they were not the only objects of mr  collins s admiration  the n    hall  the dining-room  and all its furniture  were examined and praised  n    and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs  bennet s n    heart  but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his n    own future property  the dinner too in its turn was highly admired  and n    he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its n    cooking was owing  but he was set right there by mrs  bennet  who n    assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a n    good cook  and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen  he n    begged pardon for having displeased her  in a softened tone she declared n    herself not at all offended  but he continued to apologise for about a n    quarter of an hour  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    during dinner  mr  bennet scarcely spoke at all  but when the servants n    were withdrawn  he thought it time to have some conversation with his n    guest  and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to n    shine  by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness  lady n    catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes  and consideration for n    his comfort  appeared very remarkable  mr  bennet could not have chosen n    better  mr  collins was eloquent in her praise  the subject elevated him n    to more than usual solemnity of manner  and with a most important aspect n    he protested that  he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in n    a person of rank--such affability and condescension  as he had himself n    experienced from lady catherine  she had been graciously pleased to n    approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of n    preaching before her  she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings  n    and had sent for him only the saturday before  to make up her pool of n    quadrille in the evening  lady catherine was reckoned proud by many n    people he knew  but  he  had never seen anything but affability in her  n    she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman  she n    made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the n    neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or n    two  to visit his relations  she had even condescended to advise him to n    marry as soon as he could  provided he chose with discretion  and had n    once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage  where she had perfectly n    approved all the alterations he had been making  and had even vouchsafed n    to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs   n     n     that is all very proper and civil  i am sure   said mrs  bennet   and n    i dare say she is a very agreeable woman  it is a pity that great ladies n    in general are not more like her  does she live near you  sir   n     n     the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane n    from rosings park  her ladyship  s residence   n     n     i think you said she was a widow  sir  has she any family   n     n     she has only one daughter  the heiress of rosings  and of very n    extensive property   n     n     ah   said mrs  bennet  shaking her head   then she is better off than n    many girls  and what sort of young lady is she  is she handsome   n     n     she is a most charming young lady indeed  lady catherine herself says n    that  in point of true beauty  miss de bourgh is far superior to the n    handsomest of her sex  because there is that in her features which marks n    the young lady of distinguished birth  she is unfortunately of a sickly n    constitution  which has prevented her from making that progress in many n    accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of  as i am n    informed by the lady who superintended her education  and who still n    resides with them  but she is perfectly amiable  and often condescends n    to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies   n     n     has she been presented  i do not remember her name among the ladies at n    court   n     n     her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town  n    and by that means  as i told lady catherine one day  has deprived the n    british court of its brightest ornament  her ladyship seemed pleased n    with the idea  and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to n    offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable n    to ladies  i have more than once observed to lady catherine  that n    her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess  and that the most n    elevated rank  instead of giving her consequence  would be adorned by n    her  these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship  and n    it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to n    pay   n     n     you judge very properly   said mr  bennet   and it is happy for you n    that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy  may i ask n    whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the n    moment  or are the result of previous study   n     n     they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time  and though i n    sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant n    compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions  i always wish to n    give them as unstudied an air as possible   n     n    mr  bennet s expectations were fully answered  his cousin was as absurd n    as he had hoped  and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment  n    maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance  n    and  except in an occasional glance at elizabeth  requiring no partner n    in his pleasure  n     n    by tea-time  however  the dose had been enough  and mr  bennet was glad n    to take his guest into the drawing-room again  and  when tea was over  n    glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies  mr  collins readily n    assented  and a book was produced  but  on beholding it  for everything n    announced it to be from a circulating library   he started back  and n    begging pardon  protested that he never read novels  kitty stared at n    him  and lydia exclaimed  other books were produced  and after some n    deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons  lydia gaped as he opened the n    volume  and before he had  with very monotonous solemnity  read three n    pages  she interrupted him with  n     n     do you know  mamma  that my uncle phillips talks of turning away n    richard  and if he does  colonel forster will hire him  my aunt told me n    so herself on saturday  i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more n    about it  and to ask when mr  denny comes back from town   n     n    lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue  but mr  n    collins  much offended  laid aside his book  and said  n     n     i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books n    of a serious stamp  though written solely for their benefit  it amazes n    me  i confess  for  certainly  there can be nothing so advantageous to n    them as instruction  but i will no longer importune my young cousin   n     n    then turning to mr  bennet  he offered himself as his antagonist at n    backgammon  mr  bennet accepted the challenge  observing that he acted n    very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements  n    mrs  bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia s n    interruption  and promised that it should not occur again  if he would n    resume his book  but mr  collins  after assuring them that he bore his n    young cousin no ill-will  and should never resent her behaviour as any n    affront  seated himself at another table with mr  bennet  and prepared n    for backgammon  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    mr  collins was not a sensible man  and the deficiency of nature had n    been but little assisted by education or society  the greatest part n    of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and n    miserly father  and though he belonged to one of the universities  he n    had merely kept the necessary terms  without forming at it any useful n    acquaintance  the subjection in which his father had brought him up had n    given him originally great humility of manner  but it was now a n    good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head  living in n    retirement  and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected n    prosperity  a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de n    bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant  and the respect which n    he felt for her high rank  and his veneration for her as his patroness  n    mingling with a very good opinion of himself  of his authority as a n    clergyman  and his right as a rector  made him altogether a mixture of n    pride and obsequiousness  self-importance and humility  n     n    having now a good house and a very sufficient income  he intended to n    marry  and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had n    a wife in view  as he meant to choose one of the daughters  if he found n    them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report  n    this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father s n    estate  and he thought it an excellent one  full of eligibility and n    suitableness  and excessively generous and disinterested on his own n    part  n     n    his plan did not vary on seeing them  miss bennet s lovely face n    confirmed his views  and established all his strictest notions of what n    was due to seniority  and for the first evening  she  was his settled n    choice  the next morning  however  made an alteration  for in a n    quarter of an hour s tete-a-tete with mrs  bennet before breakfast  a n    conversation beginning with his parsonage-house  and leading naturally n    to the avowal of his hopes  that a mistress might be found for it at n    longbourn  produced from her  amid very complaisant smiles and general n    encouragement  a caution against the very jane he had fixed on   as to n    her  younger  daughters  she could not take upon her to say--she could n    not positively answer--but she did not  know  of any prepossession  her n     eldest  daughter  she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her n    to hint  was likely to be very soon engaged   n     n    mr  collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon n    done--done while mrs  bennet was stirring the fire  elizabeth  equally n    next to jane in birth and beauty  succeeded her of course  n     n    mrs  bennet treasured up the hint  and trusted that she might soon have n    two daughters married  and the man whom she could not bear to speak of n    the day before was now high in her good graces  n     n    lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten  every sister n    except mary agreed to go with her  and mr  collins was to attend them  n    at the request of mr  bennet  who was most anxious to get rid of him  n    and have his library to himself  for thither mr  collins had followed n    him after breakfast  and there he would continue  nominally engaged with n    one of the largest folios in the collection  but really talking to mr  n    bennet  with little cessation  of his house and garden at hunsford  such n    doings discomposed mr  bennet exceedingly  in his library he had been n    always sure of leisure and tranquillity  and though prepared  as he told n    elizabeth  to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the n    house  he was used to be free from them there  his civility  therefore  n    was most prompt in inviting mr  collins to join his daughters in their n    walk  and mr  collins  being in fact much better fitted for a walker n    than a reader  was extremely pleased to close his large book  and go  n     n    in pompous nothings on his side  and civil assents on that of his n    cousins  their time passed till they entered meryton  the attention of n    the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him  their eyes were n    immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers  and n    nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed  or a really new muslin in n    a shop window  could recall them  n     n    but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man  whom n    they had never seen before  of most gentlemanlike appearance  walking n    with another officer on the other side of the way  the officer was n    the very mr  denny concerning whose return from london lydia came n    to inquire  and he bowed as they passed  all were struck with the n    stranger s air  all wondered who he could be  and kitty and lydia  n    determined if possible to find out  led the way across the street  under n    pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop  and fortunately n    had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen  turning back  had n    reached the same spot  mr  denny addressed them directly  and entreated n    permission to introduce his friend  mr  wickham  who had returned with n    him the day before from town  and he was happy to say had accepted a n    commission in their corps  this was exactly as it should be  for the n    young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming  n    his appearance was greatly in his favour  he had all the best part of n    beauty  a fine countenance  a good figure  and very pleasing address  n    the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness n    of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and n    unassuming  and the whole party were still standing and talking together n    very agreeably  when the sound of horses drew their notice  and darcy n    and bingley were seen riding down the street  on distinguishing the n    ladies of the group  the two gentlemen came directly towards them  and n    began the usual civilities  bingley was the principal spokesman  and n    miss bennet the principal object  he was then  he said  on his way to n    longbourn on purpose to inquire after her  mr  darcy corroborated n    it with a bow  and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes n    on elizabeth  when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the n    stranger  and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they n    looked at each other  was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting  n    both changed colour  one looked white  the other red  mr  wickham  n    after a few moments  touched his hat--a salutation which mr  darcy just n    deigned to return  what could be the meaning of it  it was impossible to n    imagine  it was impossible not to long to know  n     n    in another minute  mr  bingley  but without seeming to have noticed what n    passed  took leave and rode on with his friend  n     n    mr  denny and mr  wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of n    mr  phillip s house  and then made their bows  in spite of miss lydia s n    pressing entreaties that they should come in  and even in spite of n    mrs  phillips s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the n    invitation  n     n    mrs  phillips was always glad to see her nieces  and the two eldest  n    from their recent absence  were particularly welcome  and she was n    eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home  which  as n    their own carriage had not fetched them  she should have known nothing n    about  if she had not happened to see mr  jones s shop-boy in the n    street  who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to n    netherfield because the miss bennets were come away  when her civility n    was claimed towards mr  collins by jane s introduction of him  she n    received him with her very best politeness  which he returned with n    as much more  apologising for his intrusion  without any previous n    acquaintance with her  which he could not help flattering himself  n    however  might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who n    introduced him to her notice  mrs  phillips was quite awed by such an n    excess of good breeding  but her contemplation of one stranger was soon n    put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other  of whom  n    however  she could only tell her nieces what they already knew  that n    mr  denny had brought him from london  and that he was to have a n    lieutenant s commission in the ----shire  she had been watching him the n    last hour  she said  as he walked up and down the street  and had mr  n    wickham appeared  kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the n    occupation  but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the n    officers  who  in comparison with the stranger  were become  stupid  n    disagreeable fellows   some of them were to dine with the phillipses n    the next day  and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr  n    wickham  and give him an invitation also  if the family from longbourn n    would come in the evening  this was agreed to  and mrs  phillips n    protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery n    tickets  and a little bit of hot supper afterwards  the prospect of such n    delights was very cheering  and they parted in mutual good spirits  mr  n    collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room  and was assured n    with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless  n     n    as they walked home  elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass n    between the two gentlemen  but though jane would have defended either n    or both  had they appeared to be in the wrong  she could no more explain n    such behaviour than her sister  n     n    mr  collins on his return highly gratified mrs  bennet by admiring n    mrs  phillips s manners and politeness  he protested that  except lady n    catherine and her daughter  he had never seen a more elegant woman  n    for she had not only received him with the utmost civility  but even n    pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening  although n    utterly unknown to her before  something  he supposed  might be n    attributed to his connection with them  but yet he had never met with so n    much attention in the whole course of his life  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their n    aunt  and all mr  collins s scruples of leaving mr  and mrs  bennet for n    a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted  the coach n    conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton  and n    the girls had the pleasure of hearing  as they entered the drawing-room  n    that mr  wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation  and was then in n    the house  n     n    when this information was given  and they had all taken their seats  mr  n    collins was at leisure to look around him and admire  and he was so much n    struck with the size and furniture of the apartment  that he declared he n    might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast n    parlour at rosings  a comparison that did not at first convey much n    gratification  but when mrs  phillips understood from him what n    rosings was  and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the n    description of only one of lady catherine s drawing-rooms  and found n    that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds  she felt all n    the force of the compliment  and would hardly have resented a comparison n    with the housekeeper s room  n     n    in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion  n    with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode  and n    the improvements it was receiving  he was happily employed until the n    gentlemen joined them  and he found in mrs  phillips a very attentive n    listener  whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she n    heard  and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as n    soon as she could  to the girls  who could not listen to their cousin  n    and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument  and examine n    their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece  the n    interval of waiting appeared very long  it was over at last  however  n    the gentlemen did approach  and when mr  wickham walked into the room  n    elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before  nor thinking n    of him since  with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration  n    the officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable  n    gentlemanlike set  and the best of them were of the present party  but n    mr  wickham was as far beyond them all in person  countenance  air  and n    walk  as  they  were superior to the broad-faced  stuffy uncle phillips  n    breathing port wine  who followed them into the room  n     n    mr  wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was n    turned  and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated n    himself  and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into n    conversation  though it was only on its being a wet night  made her feel n    that the commonest  dullest  most threadbare topic might be rendered n    interesting by the skill of the speaker  n     n    with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr  wickham and the n    officers  mr  collins seemed to sink into insignificance  to the young n    ladies he certainly was nothing  but he had still at intervals a kind n    listener in mrs  phillips  and was by her watchfulness  most abundantly n    supplied with coffee and muffin  when the card-tables were placed  he n    had the opportunity of obliging her in turn  by sitting down to whist  n     n     i know little of the game at present   said he   but i shall be glad n    to improve myself  for in my situation in life--  mrs  phillips was very n    glad for his compliance  but could not wait for his reason  n     n    mr  wickham did not play at whist  and with ready delight was he n    received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia  at first there n    seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely  for she was a most n    determined talker  but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets  n    she soon grew too much interested in the game  too eager in making bets n    and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular  n    allowing for the common demands of the game  mr  wickham was therefore n    at leisure to talk to elizabeth  and she was very willing to hear n    him  though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be n    told--the history of his acquaintance with mr  darcy  she dared not n    even mention that gentleman  her curiosity  however  was unexpectedly n    relieved  mr  wickham began the subject himself  he inquired how far n    netherfield was from meryton  and  after receiving her answer  asked in n    a hesitating manner how long mr  darcy had been staying there  n     n     about a month   said elizabeth  and then  unwilling to let the subject n    drop  added   he is a man of very large property in derbyshire  i n    understand   n     n     yes   replied mr  wickham   his estate there is a noble one  a clear n    ten thousand per annum  you could not have met with a person more n    capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself  for n    i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my n    infancy   n     n    elizabeth could not but look surprised  n     n     you may well be surprised  miss bennet  at such an assertion  after n    seeing  as you probably might  the very cold manner of our meeting n    yesterday  are you much acquainted with mr  darcy   n     n     as much as i ever wish to be   cried elizabeth very warmly   i have n    spent four days in the same house with him  and i think him very n    disagreeable   n     n     i have no right to give  my  opinion   said wickham   as to his being n    agreeable or otherwise  i am not qualified to form one  i have known him n    too long and too well to be a fair judge  it is impossible for  me  n    to be impartial  but i believe your opinion of him would in general n    astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly n    anywhere else  here you are in your own family   n     n     upon my word  i say no more  here  than i might say in any house in n    the neighbourhood  except netherfield  he is not at all liked in n    hertfordshire  everybody is disgusted with his pride  you will not find n    him more favourably spoken of by anyone   n     n     i cannot pretend to be sorry   said wickham  after a short n    interruption   that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond n    their deserts  but with  him  i believe it does not often happen  the n    world is blinded by his fortune and consequence  or frightened by his n    high and imposing manners  and sees him only as he chooses to be seen   n     n     i should take him  even on  my  slight acquaintance  to be an n    ill-tempered man   wickham only shook his head  n     n     i wonder   said he  at the next opportunity of speaking   whether he is n    likely to be in this country much longer   n     n     i do not at all know  but i  heard  nothing of his going away when i n    was at netherfield  i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will n    not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood   n     n     oh  no--it is not for  me  to be driven away by mr  darcy  if  he  n    wishes to avoid seeing  me   he must go  we are not on friendly terms  n    and it always gives me pain to meet him  but i have no reason for n    avoiding  him  but what i might proclaim before all the world  a sense n    of very great ill-usage  and most painful regrets at his being what he n    is  his father  miss bennet  the late mr  darcy  was one of the best men n    that ever breathed  and the truest friend i ever had  and i can never n    be in company with this mr  darcy without being grieved to the soul by n    a thousand tender recollections  his behaviour to myself has been n    scandalous  but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and n    everything  rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the n    memory of his father   n     n    elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase  and listened with n    all her heart  but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry  n     n    mr  wickham began to speak on more general topics  meryton  the n    neighbourhood  the society  appearing highly pleased with all that n    he had yet seen  and speaking of the latter with gentle but very n    intelligible gallantry  n     n     it was the prospect of constant society  and good society   he added  n     which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire  i knew it to be n    a most respectable  agreeable corps  and my friend denny tempted me n    further by his account of their present quarters  and the very great n    attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them  n    society  i own  is necessary to me  i have been a disappointed man  and n    my spirits will not bear solitude  i  must  have employment and society  n    a military life is not what i was intended for  but circumstances have n    now made it eligible  the church  ought  to have been my profession--i n    was brought up for the church  and i should at this time have been in n    possession of a most valuable living  had it pleased the gentleman we n    were speaking of just now   n     n     indeed   n     n     yes--the late mr  darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best n    living in his gift  he was my godfather  and excessively attached to me  n    i cannot do justice to his kindness  he meant to provide for me amply  n    and thought he had done it  but when the living fell  it was given n    elsewhere   n     n     good heavens   cried elizabeth   but how could  that  be  how could his n    will be disregarded  why did you not seek legal redress   n     n     there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to n    give me no hope from law  a man of honour could not have doubted the n    intention  but mr  darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely n    conditional recommendation  and to assert that i had forfeited all claim n    to it by extravagance  imprudence--in short anything or nothing  certain n    it is  that the living became vacant two years ago  exactly as i was n    of an age to hold it  and that it was given to another man  and no n    less certain is it  that i cannot accuse myself of having really done n    anything to deserve to lose it  i have a warm  unguarded temper  and n    i may have spoken my opinion  of  him  and  to  him  too freely  i can n    recall nothing worse  but the fact is  that we are very different sort n    of men  and that he hates me   n     n     this is quite shocking  he deserves to be publicly disgraced   n     n     some time or other he  will  be--but it shall not be by  me   till i n    can forget his father  i can never defy or expose  him    n     n    elizabeth honoured him for such feelings  and thought him handsomer than n    ever as he expressed them  n     n     but what   said she  after a pause   can have been his motive  what can n    have induced him to behave so cruelly   n     n     a thorough  determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but n    attribute in some measure to jealousy  had the late mr  darcy liked me n    less  his son might have borne with me better  but his father s uncommon n    attachment to me irritated him  i believe  very early in life  he had n    not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort n    of preference which was often given me   n     n     i had not thought mr  darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked n    him  i had not thought so very ill of him  i had supposed him to be n    despising his fellow-creatures in general  but did not suspect him of n    descending to such malicious revenge  such injustice  such inhumanity as n    this   n     n    after a few minutes   reflection  however  she continued   i  do  n    remember his boasting one day  at netherfield  of the implacability of n    his resentments  of his having an unforgiving temper  his disposition n    must be dreadful   n     n     i will not trust myself on the subject   replied wickham   i can hardly n    be just to him   n     n    elizabeth was again deep in thought  and after a time exclaimed   to n    treat in such a manner the godson  the friend  the favourite of his n    father   she could have added   a young man  too  like  you   whose very n    countenance may vouch for your being amiable --but she contented herself n    with   and one  too  who had probably been his companion from childhood  n    connected together  as i think you said  in the closest manner   n     n     we were born in the same parish  within the same park  the greatest n    part of our youth was passed together  inmates of the same house  n    sharing the same amusements  objects of the same parental care   my  n    father began life in the profession which your uncle  mr  phillips  n    appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of n    use to the late mr  darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the n    pemberley property  he was most highly esteemed by mr  darcy  a most n    intimate  confidential friend  mr  darcy often acknowledged himself to n    be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence  n    and when  immediately before my father s death  mr  darcy gave him a n    voluntary promise of providing for me  i am convinced that he felt it to n    be as much a debt of gratitude to  him   as of his affection to myself   n     n     how strange   cried elizabeth   how abominable  i wonder that the very n    pride of this mr  darcy has not made him just to you  if from no better n    motive  that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for n    dishonesty i must call it   n     n     it  is  wonderful   replied wickham   for almost all his actions may n    be traced to pride  and pride had often been his best friend  it has n    connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling  but we are n    none of us consistent  and in his behaviour to me there were stronger n    impulses even than pride   n     n     can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good   n     n     yes  it has often led him to be liberal and generous  to give his money n    freely  to display hospitality  to assist his tenants  and relieve the n    poor  family pride  and  filial  pride--for he is very proud of what n    his father was--have done this  not to appear to disgrace his family  n    to degenerate from the popular qualities  or lose the influence of the n    pemberley house  is a powerful motive  he has also  brotherly  pride  n    which  with  some  brotherly affection  makes him a very kind and n    careful guardian of his sister  and you will hear him generally cried up n    as the most attentive and best of brothers   n     n     what sort of girl is miss darcy   n     n    he shook his head   i wish i could call her amiable  it gives me pain to n    speak ill of a darcy  but she is too much like her brother--very  very n    proud  as a child  she was affectionate and pleasing  and extremely fond n    of me  and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement  but she is n    nothing to me now  she is a handsome girl  about fifteen or sixteen  n    and  i understand  highly accomplished  since her father s death  her n    home has been london  where a lady lives with her  and superintends her n    education   n     n    after many pauses and many trials of other subjects  elizabeth could not n    help reverting once more to the first  and saying  n     n     i am astonished at his intimacy with mr  bingley  how can mr  bingley  n    who seems good humour itself  and is  i really believe  truly amiable  n    be in friendship with such a man  how can they suit each other  do you n    know mr  bingley   n     n     not at all   n     n     he is a sweet-tempered  amiable  charming man  he cannot know what mr  n    darcy is   n     n     probably not  but mr  darcy can please where he chooses  he does not n    want abilities  he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth n    his while  among those who are at all his equals in consequence  he is n    a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous  his n    pride never deserts him  but with the rich he is liberal-minded  just  n    sincere  rational  honourable  and perhaps agreeable--allowing something n    for fortune and figure   n     n    the whist party soon afterwards breaking up  the players gathered round n    the other table and mr  collins took his station between his cousin n    elizabeth and mrs  phillips  the usual inquiries as to his success were n    made by the latter  it had not been very great  he had lost every n    point  but when mrs  phillips began to express her concern thereupon  n    he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least n    importance  that he considered the money as a mere trifle  and begged n    that she would not make herself uneasy  n     n     i know very well  madam   said he   that when persons sit down to a n    card-table  they must take their chances of these things  and happily i n    am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object  there n    are undoubtedly many who could not say the same  but thanks to lady n    catherine de bourgh  i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding n    little matters   n     n    mr  wickham s attention was caught  and after observing mr  collins for n    a few moments  he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation n    was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh  n     n     lady catherine de bourgh   she replied   has very lately given him n    a living  i hardly know how mr  collins was first introduced to her n    notice  but he certainly has not known her long   n     n     you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy n    were sisters  consequently that she is aunt to the present mr  darcy   n     n     no  indeed  i did not  i knew nothing at all of lady catherine  s n    connections  i never heard of her existence till the day before n    yesterday   n     n     her daughter  miss de bourgh  will have a very large fortune  and it is n    believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates   n     n    this information made elizabeth smile  as she thought of poor miss n    bingley  vain indeed must be all her attentions  vain and useless her n    affection for his sister and her praise of himself  if he were already n    self-destined for another  n     n     mr  collins   said she   speaks highly both of lady catherine and her n    daughter  but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship  n    i suspect his gratitude misleads him  and that in spite of her being his n    patroness  she is an arrogant  conceited woman   n     n     i believe her to be both in a great degree   replied wickham   i have n    not seen her for many years  but i very well remember that i never liked n    her  and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent  she has the n    reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever  but i rather believe n    she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune  part from n    her authoritative manner  and the rest from the pride for her n    nephew  who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an n    understanding of the first class   n     n    elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it  and n    they continued talking together  with mutual satisfaction till supper n    put an end to cards  and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr  n    wickham s attentions  there could be no conversation in the noise n    of mrs  phillips s supper party  but his manners recommended him to n    everybody  whatever he said  was said well  and whatever he did  done n    gracefully  elizabeth went away with her head full of him  she could n    think of nothing but of mr  wickham  and of what he had told her  all n    the way home  but there was not time for her even to mention his name n    as they went  for neither lydia nor mr  collins were once silent  lydia n    talked incessantly of lottery tickets  of the fish she had lost and the n    fish she had won  and mr  collins in describing the civility of mr  and n    mrs  phillips  protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses n    at whist  enumerating all the dishes at supper  and repeatedly fearing n    that he crowded his cousins  had more to say than he could well manage n    before the carriage stopped at longbourn house  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr  n    wickham and herself  jane listened with astonishment and concern  she n    knew not how to believe that mr  darcy could be so unworthy of mr  n    bingley s regard  and yet  it was not in her nature to question the n    veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham  the n    possibility of his having endured such unkindness  was enough to n    interest all her tender feelings  and nothing remained therefore to be n    done  but to think well of them both  to defend the conduct of each  n    and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be n    otherwise explained  n     n     they have both   said she   been deceived  i dare say  in some way n    or other  of which we can form no idea  interested people have perhaps n    misrepresented each to the other  it is  in short  impossible for us to n    conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them  n    without actual blame on either side   n     n     very true  indeed  and now  my dear jane  what have you got to say on n    behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the n    business  do clear  them  too  or we shall be obliged to think ill of n    somebody   n     n     laugh as much as you choose  but you will not laugh me out of my n    opinion  my dearest lizzy  do but consider in what a disgraceful light n    it places mr  darcy  to be treating his father s favourite in such n    a manner  one whom his father had promised to provide for  it is n    impossible  no man of common humanity  no man who had any value for his n    character  could be capable of it  can his most intimate friends be so n    excessively deceived in him  oh  no   n     n     i can much more easily believe mr  bingley  s being imposed on  than n    that mr  wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me n    last night  names  facts  everything mentioned without ceremony  if it n    be not so  let mr  darcy contradict it  besides  there was truth in his n    looks   n     n     it is difficult indeed--it is distressing  one does not know what to n    think   n     n     i beg your pardon  one knows exactly what to think   n     n    but jane could think with certainty on only one point--that mr  bingley  n    if he  had  been imposed on  would have much to suffer when the affair n    became public  n     n    the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery  where this n    conversation passed  by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had n    been speaking  mr  bingley and his sisters came to give their personal n    invitation for the long-expected ball at netherfield  which was fixed n    for the following tuesday  the two ladies were delighted to see their n    dear friend again  called it an age since they had met  and repeatedly n    asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation  to n    the rest of the family they paid little attention  avoiding mrs  bennet n    as much as possible  saying not much to elizabeth  and nothing at all to n    the others  they were soon gone again  rising from their seats with an n    activity which took their brother by surprise  and hurrying off as if n    eager to escape from mrs  bennet s civilities  n     n    the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every n    female of the family  mrs  bennet chose to consider it as given in n    compliment to her eldest daughter  and was particularly flattered n    by receiving the invitation from mr  bingley himself  instead of a n    ceremonious card  jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the n    society of her two friends  and the attentions of their brother  and n    elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr  n    wickham  and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr  darcy s look n    and behaviour  the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended n    less on any single event  or any particular person  for though they n    each  like elizabeth  meant to dance half the evening with mr  wickham  n    he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them  and a ball n    was  at any rate  a ball  and even mary could assure her family that she n    had no disinclination for it  n     n     while i can have my mornings to myself   said she   it is enough--i n    think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements  n    society has claims on us all  and i profess myself one of those n    who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for n    everybody   n     n    elizabeth s spirits were so high on this occasion  that though she did n    not often speak unnecessarily to mr  collins  she could not help asking n    him whether he intended to accept mr  bingley s invitation  and if n    he did  whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s n    amusement  and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no n    scruple whatever on that head  and was very far from dreading a rebuke n    either from the archbishop  or lady catherine de bourgh  by venturing to n    dance  n     n     i am by no means of the opinion  i assure you   said he   that a ball n    of this kind  given by a young man of character  to respectable people  n    can have any evil tendency  and i am so far from objecting to dancing n    myself  that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair n    cousins in the course of the evening  and i take this opportunity of n    soliciting yours  miss elizabeth  for the two first dances especially  n    a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right n    cause  and not to any disrespect for her   n     n    elizabeth felt herself completely taken in  she had fully proposed being n    engaged by mr  wickham for those very dances  and to have mr  collins n    instead  her liveliness had never been worse timed  there was no help n    for it  however  mr  wickham s happiness and her own were perforce n    delayed a little longer  and mr  collins s proposal accepted with as n    good a grace as she could  she was not the better pleased with his n    gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more  it now first n    struck her  that  she  was selected from among her sisters as worthy n    of being mistress of hunsford parsonage  and of assisting to form a n    quadrille table at rosings  in the absence of more eligible visitors  n    the idea soon reached to conviction  as she observed his increasing n    civilities toward herself  and heard his frequent attempt at a n    compliment on her wit and vivacity  and though more astonished than n    gratified herself by this effect of her charms  it was not long before n    her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage n    was extremely agreeable to  her   elizabeth  however  did not choose n    to take the hint  being well aware that a serious dispute must be the n    consequence of any reply  mr  collins might never make the offer  and n    till he did  it was useless to quarrel about him  n     n    if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of  the n    younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this n    time  for from the day of the invitation  to the day of the ball  there n    was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton n    once  no aunt  no officers  no news could be sought after--the very n    shoe-roses for netherfield were got by proxy  even elizabeth might have n    found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the n    improvement of her acquaintance with mr  wickham  and nothing less than n    a dance on tuesday  could have made such a friday  saturday  sunday  and n    monday endurable to kitty and lydia  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield  and looked in n    vain for mr  wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled  a n    doubt of his being present had never occurred to her  the certainty n    of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that n    might not unreasonably have alarmed her  she had dressed with more than n    usual care  and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all n    that remained unsubdued of his heart  trusting that it was not more than n    might be won in the course of the evening  but in an instant arose n    the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr  darcy s n    pleasure in the bingleys  invitation to the officers  and though n    this was not exactly the case  the absolute fact of his absence was n    pronounced by his friend denny  to whom lydia eagerly applied  and who n    told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the n    day before  and was not yet returned  adding  with a significant smile  n     i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now  if n    he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here   n     n    this part of his intelligence  though unheard by lydia  was caught by n    elizabeth  and  as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for n    wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just  every n    feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate n    disappointment  that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to n    the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make  n    attendance  forbearance  patience with darcy  was injury to wickham  she n    was resolved against any sort of conversation with him  and turned away n    with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in n    speaking to mr  bingley  whose blind partiality provoked her  n     n    but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour  and though every prospect n    of her own was destroyed for the evening  it could not dwell long on her n    spirits  and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas  whom she had n    not seen for a week  she was soon able to make a voluntary transition n    to the oddities of her cousin  and to point him out to her particular n    notice  the first two dances  however  brought a return of distress  n    they were dances of mortification  mr  collins  awkward and solemn  n    apologising instead of attending  and often moving wrong without being n    aware of it  gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable n    partner for a couple of dances can give  the moment of her release from n    him was ecstasy  n     n    she danced next with an officer  and had the refreshment of talking of n    wickham  and of hearing that he was universally liked  when those dances n    were over  she returned to charlotte lucas  and was in conversation with n    her  when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr  darcy who took n    her so much by surprise in his application for her hand  that  n    without knowing what she did  she accepted him  he walked away again n    immediately  and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of n    mind  charlotte tried to console her  n     n     i dare say you will find him very agreeable   n     n     heaven forbid   that  would be the greatest misfortune of all  to find n    a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate  do not wish me such an n    evil   n     n    when the dancing recommenced  however  and darcy approached to claim her n    hand  charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper  not to be a n    simpleton  and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant n    in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence  elizabeth made no n    answer  and took her place in the set  amazed at the dignity to which n    she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr  darcy  and n    reading in her neighbours  looks  their equal amazement in beholding n    it  they stood for some time without speaking a word  and she began to n    imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances  and at n    first was resolved not to break it  till suddenly fancying that it would n    be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk  she made n    some slight observation on the dance  he replied  and was again n    silent  after a pause of some minutes  she addressed him a second time n    with -- it is  your  turn to say something now  mr  darcy  i talked n    about the dance  and  you  ought to make some sort of remark on the size n    of the room  or the number of couples   n     n    he smiled  and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be n    said  n     n     very well  that reply will do for the present  perhaps by and by i may n    observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones  but n     now  we may be silent   n     n     do you talk by rule  then  while you are dancing   n     n     sometimes  one must speak a little  you know  it would look odd to be n    entirely silent for half an hour together  and yet for the advantage of n     some   conversation ought to be so arranged  as that they may have the n    trouble of saying as little as possible   n     n     are you consulting your own feelings in the present case  or do you n    imagine that you are gratifying mine   n     n     both   replied elizabeth archly   for i have always seen a great n    similarity in the turn of our minds  we are each of an unsocial  n    taciturn disposition  unwilling to speak  unless we expect to say n    something that will amaze the whole room  and be handed down to n    posterity with all the eclat of a proverb   n     n     this is no very striking resemblance of your own character  i am sure   n    said he   how near it may be to  mine   i cannot pretend to say   you  n    think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly   n     n     i must not decide on my own performance   n     n    he made no answer  and they were again silent till they had gone down n    the dance  when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often n    walk to meryton  she answered in the affirmative  and  unable to resist n    the temptation  added   when you met us there the other day  we had just n    been forming a new acquaintance   n     n    the effect was immediate  a deeper shade of  hauteur  overspread his n    features  but he said not a word  and elizabeth  though blaming herself n    for her own weakness  could not go on  at length darcy spoke  and in a n    constrained manner said   mr  wickham is blessed with such happy manners n    as may ensure his  making  friends--whether he may be equally capable of n     retaining  them  is less certain   n     n     he has been so unlucky as to lose  your  friendship   replied elizabeth n    with emphasis   and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all n    his life   n     n    darcy made no answer  and seemed desirous of changing the subject  at n    that moment  sir william lucas appeared close to them  meaning to pass n    through the set to the other side of the room  but on perceiving mr  n    darcy  he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on n    his dancing and his partner  n     n     i have been most highly gratified indeed  my dear sir  such very n    superior dancing is not often seen  it is evident that you belong to the n    first circles  allow me to say  however  that your fair partner does not n    disgrace you  and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated  n    especially when a certain desirable event  my dear eliza  glancing at n    her sister and bingley  shall take place  what congratulations will then n    flow in  i appeal to mr  darcy --but let me not interrupt you  sir  you n    will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that n    young lady  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me   n     n    the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy  but sir n    william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly  and his n    eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and n    jane  who were dancing together  recovering himself  however  shortly  n    he turned to his partner  and said   sir william  s interruption has made n    me forget what we were talking of   n     n     i do not think we were speaking at all  sir william could not have n    interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves  n    we have tried two or three subjects already without success  and what we n    are to talk of next i cannot imagine   n     n     what think you of books   said he  smiling  n     n     books--oh  no  i am sure we never read the same  or not with the same n    feelings   n     n     i am sorry you think so  but if that be the case  there can at least be n    no want of subject  we may compare our different opinions   n     n     no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room  my head is always full of n    something else   n     n     the  present  always occupies you in such scenes--does it   said he  n    with a look of doubt  n     n     yes  always   she replied  without knowing what she said  for her n    thoughts had wandered far from the subject  as soon afterwards appeared n    by her suddenly exclaiming   i remember hearing you once say  mr  darcy  n    that you hardly ever forgave  that your resentment once created was n    unappeasable  you are very cautious  i suppose  as to its  being n    created    n     n     i am   said he  with a firm voice  n     n     and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice   n     n     i hope not   n     n     it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion  n    to be secure of judging properly at first   n     n     may i ask to what these questions tend   n     n     merely to the illustration of  your  character   said she  endeavouring n    to shake off her gravity   i am trying to make it out   n     n     and what is your success   n     n    she shook her head   i do not get on at all  i hear such different n    accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly   n     n     i can readily believe   answered he gravely   that reports may vary n    greatly with respect to me  and i could wish  miss bennet  that you were n    not to sketch my character at the present moment  as there is reason to n    fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either   n     n     but if i do not take your likeness now  i may never have another n    opportunity   n     n     i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours   he coldly replied  n    she said no more  and they went down the other dance and parted in n    silence  and on each side dissatisfied  though not to an equal degree  n    for in darcy s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards n    her  which soon procured her pardon  and directed all his anger against n    another  n     n    they had not long separated  when miss bingley came towards her  and n    with an expression of civil disdain accosted her  n     n     so  miss eliza  i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham  n    your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking me a thousand n    questions  and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you  among n    his other communication  that he was the son of old wickham  the late n    mr  darcy s steward  let me recommend you  however  as a friend  not to n    give implicit confidence to all his assertions  for as to mr  darcy s n    using him ill  it is perfectly false  for  on the contrary  he has n    always been remarkably kind to him  though george wickham has treated n    mr  darcy in a most infamous manner  i do not know the particulars  but n    i know very well that mr  darcy is not in the least to blame  that he n    cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned  and that though my brother n    thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to n    the officers  he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself n    out of the way  his coming into the country at all is a most insolent n    thing  indeed  and i wonder how he could presume to do it  i pity you  n    miss eliza  for this discovery of your favourite s guilt  but really  n    considering his descent  one could not expect much better   n     n     his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same   said n    elizabeth angrily   for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse n    than of being the son of mr  darcy s steward  and of  that   i can n    assure you  he informed me himself   n     n     i beg your pardon   replied miss bingley  turning away with a sneer  n     excuse my interference--it was kindly meant   n     n     insolent girl   said elizabeth to herself   you are much mistaken n    if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this  i see n    nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr  n    darcy   she then sought her eldest sister  who had undertaken to make n    inquiries on the same subject of bingley  jane met her with a smile of n    such sweet complacency  a glow of such happy expression  as sufficiently n    marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening  n    elizabeth instantly read her feelings  and at that moment solicitude for n    wickham  resentment against his enemies  and everything else  gave way n    before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness  n     n     i want to know   said she  with a countenance no less smiling than her n    sister  s   what you have learnt about mr  wickham  but perhaps you have n    been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person  in which case n    you may be sure of my pardon   n     n     no   replied jane   i have not forgotten him  but i have nothing n    satisfactory to tell you  mr  bingley does not know the whole of n    his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have n    principally offended mr  darcy  but he will vouch for the good conduct  n    the probity  and honour of his friend  and is perfectly convinced that n    mr  wickham has deserved much less attention from mr  darcy than he has n    received  and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister s  n    mr  wickham is by no means a respectable young man  i am afraid he has n    been very imprudent  and has deserved to lose mr  darcy  s regard   n     n     mr  bingley does not know mr  wickham himself   n     n     no  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton   n     n     this account then is what he has received from mr  darcy  i am n    satisfied  but what does he say of the living   n     n     he does not exactly recollect the circumstances  though he has heard n    them from mr  darcy more than once  but he believes that it was left to n    him  conditionally  only   n     n     i have not a doubt of mr  bingley  s sincerity   said elizabeth warmly  n     but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only  mr  n    bingley s defense of his friend was a very able one  i dare say  but n    since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story  and has learnt n    the rest from that friend himself  i shall venture to still think of n    both gentlemen as i did before   n     n    she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each  and on n    which there could be no difference of sentiment  elizabeth listened with n    delight to the happy  though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr  n    bingley s regard  and said all in her power to heighten her confidence n    in it  on their being joined by mr  bingley himself  elizabeth withdrew n    to miss lucas  to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last n    partner she had scarcely replied  before mr  collins came up to them  n    and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as n    to make a most important discovery  n     n     i have found out   said he   by a singular accident  that there is now n    in the room a near relation of my patroness  i happened to overhear the n    gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of n    the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh  and of her mother lady n    catherine  how wonderfully these sort of things occur  who would have n    thought of my meeting with  perhaps  a nephew of lady catherine de n    bourgh in this assembly  i am most thankful that the discovery is made n    in time for me to pay my respects to him  which i am now going to n    do  and trust he will excuse my not having done it before  my total n    ignorance of the connection must plead my apology   n     n     you are not going to introduce yourself to mr  darcy   n     n     indeed i am  i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier  n    i believe him to be lady catherine s  nephew   it will be in my power to n    assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se  nnight   n     n    elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  assuring him n    that mr  darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction n    as an impertinent freedom  rather than a compliment to his aunt  that n    it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either n    side  and that if it were  it must belong to mr  darcy  the superior in n    consequence  to begin the acquaintance  mr  collins listened to her n    with the determined air of following his own inclination  and  when she n    ceased speaking  replied thus  n     n     my dear miss elizabeth  i have the highest opinion in the world in n    your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your n    understanding  but permit me to say  that there must be a wide n    difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity  n    and those which regulate the clergy  for  give me leave to observe that n    i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with n    the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of n    behaviour is at the same time maintained  you must therefore allow me to n    follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to n    perform what i look on as a point of duty  pardon me for neglecting to n    profit by your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant n    guide  though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by n    education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young n    lady like yourself   and with a low bow he left her to attack mr  n    darcy  whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched  and whose n    astonishment at being so addressed was very evident  her cousin prefaced n    his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of n    it  she felt as if hearing it all  and saw in the motion of his lips the n    words  apology    hunsford   and  lady catherine de bourgh   it vexed n    her to see him expose himself to such a man  mr  darcy was eyeing him n    with unrestrained wonder  and when at last mr  collins allowed him time n    to speak  replied with an air of distant civility  mr  collins  however  n    was not discouraged from speaking again  and mr  darcy s contempt seemed n    abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech  and at the n    end of it he only made him a slight bow  and moved another way  mr  n    collins then returned to elizabeth  n     n     i have no reason  i assure you   said he   to be dissatisfied with my n    reception  mr  darcy seemed much pleased with the attention  he answered n    me with the utmost civility  and even paid me the compliment of saying n    that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be n    certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily  it was really a very n    handsome thought  upon the whole  i am much pleased with him   n     n    as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue  she turned n    her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr  bingley  and the n    train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to  n    made her perhaps almost as happy as jane  she saw her in idea settled in n    that very house  in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection n    could bestow  and she felt capable  under such circumstances  of n    endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters  her mother s thoughts n    she plainly saw were bent the same way  and she determined not to n    venture near her  lest she might hear too much  when they sat down to n    supper  therefore  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which n    placed them within one of each other  and deeply was she vexed to find n    that her mother was talking to that one person  lady lucas  freely  n    openly  and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon n    be married to mr  bingley  it was an animating subject  and mrs  bennet n    seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the n    match  his being such a charming young man  and so rich  and living but n    three miles from them  were the first points of self-gratulation  and n    then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of n    jane  and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as n    she could do  it was  moreover  such a promising thing for her younger n    daughters  as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of n    other rich men  and lastly  it was so pleasant at her time of life to be n    able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister  that n    she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked  it was n    necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure  because on n    such occasions it is the etiquette  but no one was less likely than mrs  n    bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life  she n    concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally n    fortunate  though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no n    chance of it  n     n    in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s n    words  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible n    whisper  for  to her inexpressible vexation  she could perceive that the n    chief of it was overheard by mr  darcy  who sat opposite to them  her n    mother only scolded her for being nonsensical  n     n     what is mr  darcy to me  pray  that i should be afraid of him  i am n    sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say n    nothing  he  may not like to hear   n     n     for heaven  s sake  madam  speak lower  what advantage can it be for you n    to offend mr  darcy  you will never recommend yourself to his friend by n    so doing   n     n    nothing that she could say  however  had any influence  her mother would n    talk of her views in the same intelligible tone  elizabeth blushed and n    blushed again with shame and vexation  she could not help frequently n    glancing her eye at mr  darcy  though every glance convinced her of what n    she dreaded  for though he was not always looking at her mother  she was n    convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her  the expression n    of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and n    steady gravity  n     n    at length  however  mrs  bennet had no more to say  and lady lucas  who n    had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no n    likelihood of sharing  was left to the comforts of cold ham and n    chicken  elizabeth now began to revive  but not long was the interval of n    tranquillity  for  when supper was over  singing was talked of  and n    she had the mortification of seeing mary  after very little entreaty  n    preparing to oblige the company  by many significant looks and silent n    entreaties  did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance  n    but in vain  mary would not understand them  such an opportunity of n    exhibiting was delightful to her  and she began her song  elizabeth s n    eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations  and she watched her n    progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very n    ill rewarded at their close  for mary  on receiving  amongst the thanks n    of the table  the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to n    favour them again  after the pause of half a minute began another  n    mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display  her voice was n    weak  and her manner affected  elizabeth was in agonies  she looked at n    jane  to see how she bore it  but jane was very composedly talking to n    bingley  she looked at his two sisters  and saw them making signs n    of derision at each other  and at darcy  who continued  however  n    imperturbably grave  she looked at her father to entreat his n    interference  lest mary should be singing all night  he took the hint  n    and when mary had finished her second song  said aloud   that will do n    extremely well  child  you have delighted us long enough  let the other n    young ladies have time to exhibit   n     n    mary  though pretending not to hear  was somewhat disconcerted  and n    elizabeth  sorry for her  and sorry for her father s speech  was afraid n    her anxiety had done no good  others of the party were now applied to  n     n     if i   said mr  collins   were so fortunate as to be able to sing  i n    should have great pleasure  i am sure  in obliging the company with an n    air  for i consider music as a very innocent diversion  and perfectly n    compatible with the profession of a clergyman  i do not mean  however  n    to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time n    to music  for there are certainly other things to be attended to  the n    rector of a parish has much to do  in the first place  he must make n    such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not n    offensive to his patron  he must write his own sermons  and the time n    that remains will not be too much for his parish duties  and the care n    and improvement of his dwelling  which he cannot be excused from making n    as comfortable as possible  and i do not think it of light importance n    that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody  n    especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment  i cannot acquit n    him of that duty  nor could i think well of the man who should omit an n    occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the n    family   and with a bow to mr  darcy  he concluded his speech  which had n    been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room  many stared--many n    smiled  but no one looked more amused than mr  bennet himself  while his n    wife seriously commended mr  collins for having spoken so sensibly  n    and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas  that he was a remarkably n    clever  good kind of young man  n     n    to elizabeth it appeared that  had her family made an agreement to n    expose themselves as much as they could during the evening  it would n    have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or n    finer success  and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister n    that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice  and that his n    feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he n    must have witnessed  that his two sisters and mr  darcy  however  should n    have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations  was bad enough  n    and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the n    gentleman  or the insolent smiles of the ladies  were more intolerable  n     n    the rest of the evening brought her little amusement  she was teased by n    mr  collins  who continued most perseveringly by her side  and though n    he could not prevail on her to dance with him again  put it out of her n    power to dance with others  in vain did she entreat him to stand up with n    somebody else  and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room  n    he assured her  that as to dancing  he was perfectly indifferent to it  n    that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to n    her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her n    the whole evening  there was no arguing upon such a project  she owed n    her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas  who often joined them  and n    good-naturedly engaged mr  collins s conversation to herself  n     n    she was at least free from the offense of mr  darcy s further notice  n    though often standing within a very short distance of her  quite n    disengaged  he never came near enough to speak  she felt it to be the n    probable consequence of her allusions to mr  wickham  and rejoiced in n    it  n     n    the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart  and  by n    a manoeuvre of mrs  bennet  had to wait for their carriage a quarter of n    an hour after everybody else was gone  which gave them time to see how n    heartily they were wished away by some of the family  mrs  hurst and her n    sister scarcely opened their mouths  except to complain of fatigue  and n    were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves  they repulsed n    every attempt of mrs  bennet at conversation  and by so doing threw a n    languor over the whole party  which was very little relieved by the n    long speeches of mr  collins  who was complimenting mr  bingley and his n    sisters on the elegance of their entertainment  and the hospitality and n    politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests  darcy said n    nothing at all  mr  bennet  in equal silence  was enjoying the scene  n    mr  bingley and jane were standing together  a little detached from the n    rest  and talked only to each other  elizabeth preserved as steady a n    silence as either mrs  hurst or miss bingley  and even lydia was too n    much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of  lord  n    how tired i am   accompanied by a violent yawn  n     n    when at length they arose to take leave  mrs  bennet was most pressingly n    civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn  and n    addressed herself especially to mr  bingley  to assure him how happy he n    would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time  without n    the ceremony of a formal invitation  bingley was all grateful pleasure  n    and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on n    her  after his return from london  whither he was obliged to go the next n    day for a short time  n     n    mrs  bennet was perfectly satisfied  and quitted the house under the n    delightful persuasion that  allowing for the necessary preparations of n    settlements  new carriages  and wedding clothes  she should undoubtedly n    see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four n    months  of having another daughter married to mr  collins  she thought n    with equal certainty  and with considerable  though not equal  pleasure  n    elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children  and though the n    man and the match were quite good enough for  her   the worth of each n    was eclipsed by mr  bingley and netherfield  n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    the next day opened a new scene at longbourn  mr  collins made his n    declaration in form  having resolved to do it without loss of time  as n    his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday  and having n    no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at n    the moment  he set about it in a very orderly manner  with all the n    observances  which he supposed a regular part of the business  on n    finding mrs  bennet  elizabeth  and one of the younger girls together  n    soon after breakfast  he addressed the mother in these words  n     n     may i hope  madam  for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth  n    when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the n    course of this morning   n     n    before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise  mrs  n    bennet answered instantly   oh dear --yes--certainly  i am sure lizzy n    will be very happy--i am sure she can have no objection  come  kitty  i n    want you up stairs   and  gathering her work together  she was hastening n    away  when elizabeth called out  n     n     dear madam  do not go  i beg you will not go  mr  collins must excuse n    me  he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear  i am n    going away myself   n     n     no  no  nonsense  lizzy  i desire you to stay where you are   and upon n    elizabeth s seeming really  with vexed and embarrassed looks  about to n    escape  she added   lizzy  i  insist  upon your staying and hearing mr  n    collins   n     n    elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment s n    consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it n    over as soon and as quietly as possible  she sat down again and tried to n    conceal  by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between n    distress and diversion  mrs  bennet and kitty walked off  and as soon as n    they were gone  mr  collins began  n     n     believe me  my dear miss elizabeth  that your modesty  so far from n    doing you any disservice  rather adds to your other perfections  you n    would have been less amiable in my eyes had there  not  been this little n    unwillingness  but allow me to assure you  that i have your respected n    mother s permission for this address  you can hardly doubt the n    purport of my discourse  however your natural delicacy may lead you to n    dissemble  my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken  almost as n    soon as i entered the house  i singled you out as the companion of n    my future life  but before i am run away with by my feelings on this n    subject  perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for n    marrying--and  moreover  for coming into hertfordshire with the design n    of selecting a wife  as i certainly did   n     n    the idea of mr  collins  with all his solemn composure  being run away n    with by his feelings  made elizabeth so near laughing  that she could n    not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further  n    and he continued  n     n     my reasons for marrying are  first  that i think it a right thing for n    every clergyman in easy circumstances  like myself  to set the example n    of matrimony in his parish  secondly  that i am convinced that it will n    add very greatly to my happiness  and thirdly--which perhaps i ought n    to have mentioned earlier  that it is the particular advice and n    recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling n    patroness  twice has she condescended to give me her opinion  unasked n    too   on this subject  and it was but the very saturday night before i n    left hunsford--between our pools at quadrille  while mrs  jenkinson was n    arranging miss de bourgh s footstool  that she said   mr  collins  you n    must marry  a clergyman like you must marry  choose properly  choose n    a gentlewoman for  my  sake  and for your  own   let her be an active  n    useful sort of person  not brought up high  but able to make a small n    income go a good way  this is my advice  find such a woman as soon as n    you can  bring her to hunsford  and i will visit her   allow me  by the n    way  to observe  my fair cousin  that i do not reckon the notice n    and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the n    advantages in my power to offer  you will find her manners beyond n    anything i can describe  and your wit and vivacity  i think  must be n    acceptable to her  especially when tempered with the silence and n    respect which her rank will inevitably excite  thus much for my general n    intention in favour of matrimony  it remains to be told why my views n    were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood  where i n    can assure you there are many amiable young women  but the fact is  that n    being  as i am  to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured n    father  who  however  may live many years longer   i could not satisfy n    myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters  that n    the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the melancholy n    event takes place--which  however  as i have already said  may not n    be for several years  this has been my motive  my fair cousin  and n    i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem  and now nothing n    remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the n    violence of my affection  to fortune i am perfectly indifferent  and n    shall make no demand of that nature on your father  since i am well n    aware that it could not be complied with  and that one thousand pounds n    in the four per cents  which will not be yours till after your mother s n    decease  is all that you may ever be entitled to  on that head  n    therefore  i shall be uniformly silent  and you may assure yourself that n    no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married   n     n    it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now  n     n     you are too hasty  sir   she cried   you forget that i have made no n    answer  let me do it without further loss of time  accept my thanks for n    the compliment you are paying me  i am very sensible of the honour of n    your proposals  but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to n    decline them   n     n     i am not now to learn   replied mr  collins  with a formal wave of the n    hand   that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the n    man whom they secretly mean to accept  when he first applies for their n    favour  and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second  or even a n    third time  i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just n    said  and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long   n     n     upon my word  sir   cried elizabeth   your hope is a rather n    extraordinary one after my declaration  i do assure you that i am not n    one of those young ladies  if such young ladies there are  who are so n    daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second n    time  i am perfectly serious in my refusal  you could not make  me  n    happy  and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who n    could make you so  nay  were your friend lady catherine to know me  i n    am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the n    situation   n     n     were it certain that lady catherine would think so   said mr  collins n    very gravely-- but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all n    disapprove of you  and you may be certain when i have the honour of n    seeing her again  i shall speak in the very highest terms of your n    modesty  economy  and other amiable qualification   n     n     indeed  mr  collins  all praise of me will be unnecessary  you n    must give me leave to judge for myself  and pay me the compliment n    of believing what i say  i wish you very happy and very rich  and by n    refusing your hand  do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise  n    in making me the offer  you must have satisfied the delicacy of your n    feelings with regard to my family  and may take possession of longbourn n    estate whenever it falls  without any self-reproach  this matter may n    be considered  therefore  as finally settled   and rising as she n    thus spoke  she would have quitted the room  had mr  collins not thus n    addressed her  n     n     when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject  i n    shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given n    me  though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present  because i n    know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on n    the first application  and perhaps you have even now said as much to n    encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the n    female character   n     n     really  mr  collins   cried elizabeth with some warmth   you puzzle me n    exceedingly  if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form n    of encouragement  i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as n    to convince you of its being one   n     n     you must give me leave to flatter myself  my dear cousin  that your n    refusal of my addresses is merely words of course  my reasons for n    believing it are briefly these  it does not appear to me that my hand is n    unworthy of your acceptance  or that the establishment i can offer would n    be any other than highly desirable  my situation in life  my connections n    with the family of de bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are n    circumstances highly in my favour  and you should take it into further n    consideration  that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is by no n    means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you  your n    portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo n    the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications  as i must n    therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me  n    i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by n    suspense  according to the usual practice of elegant females   n     n     i do assure you  sir  that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind n    of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man  i would n    rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere  i thank you n    again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals  but n    to accept them is absolutely impossible  my feelings in every respect n    forbid it  can i speak plainer  do not consider me now as an elegant n    female  intending to plague you  but as a rational creature  speaking n    the truth from her heart   n     n     you are uniformly charming   cried he  with an air of awkward n    gallantry   and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express n    authority of both your excellent parents  my proposals will not fail of n    being acceptable   n     n    to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make n    no reply  and immediately and in silence withdrew  determined  if n    he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering n    encouragement  to apply to her father  whose negative might be uttered n    in such a manner as to be decisive  and whose behaviour at least could n    not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    mr  collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his n    successful love  for mrs  bennet  having dawdled about in the vestibule n    to watch for the end of the conference  no sooner saw elizabeth open n    the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase  than she n    entered the breakfast-room  and congratulated both him and herself in n    warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection  mr  collins n    received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure  and then n    proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview  with the result n    of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied  since the n    refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow n    from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character  n     n    this information  however  startled mrs  bennet  she would have been n    glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage n    him by protesting against his proposals  but she dared not believe it  n    and could not help saying so  n     n     but  depend upon it  mr  collins   she added   that lizzy shall be n    brought to reason  i will speak to her about it directly  she is a very n    headstrong  foolish girl  and does not know her own interest but i will n     make  her know it   n     n     pardon me for interrupting you  madam   cried mr  collins   but if n    she is really headstrong and foolish  i know not whether she would n    altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation  who n    naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state  if therefore she n    actually persists in rejecting my suit  perhaps it were better not n    to force her into accepting me  because if liable to such defects of n    temper  she could not contribute much to my felicity   n     n     sir  you quite misunderstand me   said mrs  bennet  alarmed   lizzy is n    only headstrong in such matters as these  in everything else she is as n    good-natured a girl as ever lived  i will go directly to mr  bennet  and n    we shall very soon settle it with her  i am sure   n     n    she would not give him time to reply  but hurrying instantly to her n    husband  called out as she entered the library   oh  mr  bennet  you n    are wanted immediately  we are all in an uproar  you must come and make n    lizzy marry mr  collins  for she vows she will not have him  and if you n    do not make haste he will change his mind and not have  her    n     n    mr  bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered  and fixed them n    on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by n    her communication  n     n     i have not the pleasure of understanding you   said he  when she had n    finished her speech   of what are you talking   n     n     of mr  collins and lizzy  lizzy declares she will not have mr  collins  n    and mr  collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy   n     n     and what am i to do on the occasion  it seems an hopeless business   n     n     speak to lizzy about it yourself  tell her that you insist upon her n    marrying him   n     n     let her be called down  she shall hear my opinion   n     n    mrs  bennet rang the bell  and miss elizabeth was summoned to the n    library  n     n     come here  child   cried her father as she appeared   i have sent for n    you on an affair of importance  i understand that mr  collins has made n    you an offer of marriage  is it true   elizabeth replied that it was  n     very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused   n     n     i have  sir   n     n     very well  we now come to the point  your mother insists upon your n    accepting it  is it not so  mrs  bennet   n     n     yes  or i will never see her again   n     n     an unhappy alternative is before you  elizabeth  from this day you must n    be a stranger to one of your parents  your mother will never see you n    again if you do  not  marry mr  collins  and i will never see you again n    if you  do    n     n    elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning  n    but mrs  bennet  who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the n    affair as she wished  was excessively disappointed  n     n     what do you mean  mr  bennet  in talking this way  you promised me to n     insist  upon her marrying him   n     n     my dear   replied her husband   i have two small favours to request  n    first  that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the n    present occasion  and secondly  of my room  i shall be glad to have the n    library to myself as soon as may be   n     n    not yet  however  in spite of her disappointment in her husband  did n    mrs  bennet give up the point  she talked to elizabeth again and again  n    coaxed and threatened her by turns  she endeavoured to secure jane n    in her interest  but jane  with all possible mildness  declined n    interfering  and elizabeth  sometimes with real earnestness  and n    sometimes with playful gaiety  replied to her attacks  though her manner n    varied  however  her determination never did  n     n    mr  collins  meanwhile  was meditating in solitude on what had passed  n    he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin n    could refuse him  and though his pride was hurt  he suffered in no other n    way  his regard for her was quite imaginary  and the possibility of her n    deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret  n     n    while the family were in this confusion  charlotte lucas came to spend n    the day with them  she was met in the vestibule by lydia  who  flying to n    her  cried in a half whisper   i am glad you are come  for there is such n    fun here  what do you think has happened this morning  mr  collins has n    made an offer to lizzy  and she will not have him   n     n    charlotte hardly had time to answer  before they were joined by kitty  n    who came to tell the same news  and no sooner had they entered the n    breakfast-room  where mrs  bennet was alone  than she likewise began on n    the subject  calling on miss lucas for her compassion  and entreating n    her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her n    family   pray do  my dear miss lucas   she added in a melancholy tone  n     for nobody is on my side  nobody takes part with me  i am cruelly used  n    nobody feels for my poor nerves   n     n    charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth  n     n     aye  there she comes   continued mrs  bennet   looking as unconcerned n    as may be  and caring no more for us than if we were at york  provided n    she can have her own way  but i tell you  miss lizzy--if you take it n    into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way  n    you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is n    to maintain you when your father is dead  i shall not be able to keep n    you--and so i warn you  i have done with you from this very day  i told n    you in the library  you know  that i should never speak to you again  n    and you will find me as good as my word  i have no pleasure in talking n    to undutiful children  not that i have much pleasure  indeed  in talking n    to anybody  people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have n    no great inclination for talking  nobody can tell what i suffer  but it n    is always so  those who do not complain are never pitied   n     n    her daughters listened in silence to this effusion  sensible that n    any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the n    irritation  she talked on  therefore  without interruption from any of n    them  till they were joined by mr  collins  who entered the room with n    an air more stately than usual  and on perceiving whom  she said to n    the girls   now  i do insist upon it  that you  all of you  hold n    your tongues  and let me and mr  collins have a little conversation n    together   n     n    elizabeth passed quietly out of the room  jane and kitty followed  but n    lydia stood her ground  determined to hear all she could  and charlotte  n    detained first by the civility of mr  collins  whose inquiries after n    herself and all her family were very minute  and then by a little n    curiosity  satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending n    not to hear  in a doleful voice mrs  bennet began the projected n    conversation   oh  mr  collins   n     n     my dear madam   replied he   let us be for ever silent on this point  n    far be it from me   he presently continued  in a voice that marked his n    displeasure   to resent the behaviour of your daughter  resignation n    to inevitable evils is the duty of us all  the peculiar duty of a n    young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment  n    and i trust i am resigned  perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt n    of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand  n    for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as n    when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our n    estimation  you will not  i hope  consider me as showing any disrespect n    to your family  my dear madam  by thus withdrawing my pretensions to n    your daughter s favour  without having paid yourself and mr  bennet the n    compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my n    behalf  my conduct may  i fear  be objectionable in having accepted my n    dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own  but we are all n    liable to error  i have certainly meant well through the whole affair  n    my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself  with due n    consideration for the advantage of all your family  and if my  manner  n    has been at all reprehensible  i here beg leave to apologise   n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    the discussion of mr  collins s offer was now nearly at an end  and n    elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily n    attending it  and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her n    mother  as for the gentleman himself   his  feelings were chiefly n    expressed  not by embarrassment or dejection  or by trying to avoid her  n    but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence  he scarcely ever spoke n    to her  and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of n    himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas  whose n    civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all  and n    especially to her friend  n     n    the morrow produced no abatement of mrs  bennet s ill-humour or ill n    health  mr  collins was also in the same state of angry pride  elizabeth n    had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit  but his plan did n    not appear in the least affected by it  he was always to have gone on n    saturday  and to saturday he meant to stay  n     n    after breakfast  the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr  wickham n    were returned  and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball  n    he joined them on their entering the town  and attended them to their n    aunt s where his regret and vexation  and the concern of everybody  was n    well talked over  to elizabeth  however  he voluntarily acknowledged n    that the necessity of his absence  had  been self-imposed  n     n     i found   said he   as the time drew near that i had better not meet n    mr  darcy  that to be in the same room  the same party with him for so n    many hours together  might be more than i could bear  and that scenes n    might arise unpleasant to more than myself   n     n    she highly approved his forbearance  and they had leisure for a full n    discussion of it  and for all the commendation which they civilly n    bestowed on each other  as wickham and another officer walked back with n    them to longbourn  and during the walk he particularly attended to n    her  his accompanying them was a double advantage  she felt all the n    compliment it offered to herself  and it was most acceptable as an n    occasion of introducing him to her father and mother  n     n    soon after their return  a letter was delivered to miss bennet  it came n    from netherfield  the envelope contained a sheet of elegant  little  n    hot-pressed paper  well covered with a lady s fair  flowing hand  and n    elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it  and saw n    her dwelling intently on some particular passages  jane recollected n    herself soon  and putting the letter away  tried to join with her usual n    cheerfulness in the general conversation  but elizabeth felt an anxiety n    on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham  and no n    sooner had he and his companion taken leave  than a glance from jane n    invited her to follow her up stairs  when they had gained their own room  n    jane  taking out the letter  said  n     n     this is from caroline bingley  what it contains has surprised me a good n    deal  the whole party have left netherfield by this time  and are on n    their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again  you n    shall hear what she says   n     n    she then read the first sentence aloud  which comprised the information n    of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly  n    and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street  where mr  hurst had a n    house  the next was in these words   i do not pretend to regret anything n    i shall leave in hertfordshire  except your society  my dearest friend  n    but we will hope  at some future period  to enjoy many returns of that n    delightful intercourse we have known  and in the meanwhile may n    lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved n    correspondence  i depend on you for that   to these highflown n    expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust  n    and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her  she saw n    nothing in it really to lament  it was not to be supposed that their n    absence from netherfield would prevent mr  bingley s being there  and as n    to the loss of their society  she was persuaded that jane must cease to n    regard it  in the enjoyment of his  n     n     it is unlucky   said she  after a short pause   that you should not be n    able to see your friends before they leave the country  but may we not n    hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks n    forward may arrive earlier than she is aware  and that the delightful n    intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater n    satisfaction as sisters  mr  bingley will not be detained in london by n    them   n     n     caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into n    hertfordshire this winter  i will read it to you   n     n     when my brother left us yesterday  he imagined that the business which n    took him to london might be concluded in three or four days  but as we n    are certain it cannot be so  and at the same time convinced that when n    charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again  we have n    determined on following him thither  that he may not be obliged to spend n    his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel  many of my acquaintances are n    already there for the winter  i wish that i could hear that you  my n    dearest friend  had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of n    that i despair  i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may n    abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings  and that your n    beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the n    three of whom we shall deprive you   n     n     it is evident by this   added jane   that he comes back no more this n    winter   n     n     it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he  should    n     n     why will you think so  it must be his own doing  he is his own n    master  but you do not know  all   i  will  read you the passage which n    particularly hurts me  i will have no reserves from  you    n     n     mr  darcy is impatient to see his sister  and  to confess the truth  n     we  are scarcely less eager to meet her again  i really do not think n    georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty  elegance  and accomplishments  n    and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into n    something still more interesting  from the hope we dare entertain of n    her being hereafter our sister  i do not know whether i ever before n    mentioned to you my feelings on this subject  but i will not leave the n    country without confiding them  and i trust you will not esteem them n    unreasonable  my brother admires her greatly already  he will have n    frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing  n    her relations all wish the connection as much as his own  and a sister s n    partiality is not misleading me  i think  when i call charles most n    capable of engaging any woman s heart  with all these circumstances to n    favour an attachment  and nothing to prevent it  am i wrong  my dearest n    jane  in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness n    of so many   n     n     what do you think of  this  sentence  my dear lizzy   said jane as she n    finished it   is it not clear enough  does it not expressly declare that n    caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister  that she is n    perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference  and that if she n    suspects the nature of my feelings for him  she means  most kindly   to n    put me on my guard  can there be any other opinion on the subject   n     n     yes  there can  for mine is totally different  will you hear it   n     n     most willingly   n     n     you shall have it in a few words  miss bingley sees that her brother is n    in love with you  and wants him to marry miss darcy  she follows him n    to town in hope of keeping him there  and tries to persuade you that he n    does not care about you   n     n    jane shook her head  n     n     indeed  jane  you ought to believe me  no one who has ever seen you n    together can doubt his affection  miss bingley  i am sure  cannot  she n    is not such a simpleton  could she have seen half as much love in mr  n    darcy for herself  she would have ordered her wedding clothes  but the n    case is this  we are not rich enough or grand enough for them  and she n    is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother  from the notion n    that when there has been  one  intermarriage  she may have less trouble n    in achieving a second  in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and n    i dare say it would succeed  if miss de bourgh were out of the way  but  n    my dearest jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley n    tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy  he is in the smallest n    degree less sensible of  your  merit than when he took leave of you on n    tuesday  or that it will be in her power to persuade him that  instead n    of being in love with you  he is very much in love with her friend   n     n     if we thought alike of miss bingley   replied jane   your n    representation of all this might make me quite easy  but i know the n    foundation is unjust  caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving n    anyone  and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving n    herself   n     n     that is right  you could not have started a more happy idea  since you n    will not take comfort in mine  believe her to be deceived  by all means  n    you have now done your duty by her  and must fret no longer   n     n     but  my dear sister  can i be happy  even supposing the best  in n    accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry n    elsewhere   n     n     you must decide for yourself   said elizabeth   and if  upon mature n    deliberation  you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is n    more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife  i advise you by n    all means to refuse him   n     n     how can you talk so   said jane  faintly smiling   you must know that n    though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation  i could n    not hesitate   n     n     i did not think you would  and that being the case  i cannot consider n    your situation with much compassion   n     n     but if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be n    required  a thousand things may arise in six months   n     n    the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost n    contempt  it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s n    interested wishes  and she could not for a moment suppose that those n    wishes  however openly or artfully spoken  could influence a young man n    so totally independent of everyone  n     n    she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt n    on the subject  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect  n    jane s temper was not desponding  and she was gradually led to hope  n    though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope  that n    bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart  n     n    they agreed that mrs  bennet should only hear of the departure of the n    family  without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct  n    but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern  n    and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen n    to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together  after n    lamenting it  however  at some length  she had the consolation that mr  n    bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn  and the n    conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration  that though he had n    been invited only to a family dinner  she would take care to have two n    full courses  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the n    chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr  collins  n    elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her   it keeps him in good n    humour   said she   and i am more obliged to you than i can express   n    charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful  and n    that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time  this was n    very amiable  but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth n    had any conception of  its object was nothing else than to secure her n    from any return of mr  collins s addresses  by engaging them towards n    herself  such was miss lucas s scheme  and appearances were so n    favourable  that when they parted at night  she would have felt almost n    secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very n    soon  but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his n    character  for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next n    morning with admirable slyness  and hasten to lucas lodge to throw n    himself at her feet  he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins  n    from a conviction that if they saw him depart  they could not fail to n    conjecture his design  and he was not willing to have the attempt known n    till its success might be known likewise  for though feeling almost n    secure  and with reason  for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging  n    he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday  n    his reception  however  was of the most flattering kind  miss lucas n    perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house  and n    instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane  but little had n    she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there  n     n    in as short a time as mr  collins s long speeches would allow  n    everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both  and as n    they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that n    was to make him the happiest of men  and though such a solicitation must n    be waived for the present  the lady felt no inclination to trifle with n    his happiness  the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must n    guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its n    continuance  and miss lucas  who accepted him solely from the pure n    and disinterested desire of an establishment  cared not how soon that n    establishment were gained  n     n    sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent  n    and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity  mr  collins s present n    circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter  to whom n    they could give little fortune  and his prospects of future wealth were n    exceedingly fair  lady lucas began directly to calculate  with more n    interest than the matter had ever excited before  how many years longer n    mr  bennet was likely to live  and sir william gave it as his decided n    opinion  that whenever mr  collins should be in possession of the n    longbourn estate  it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife n    should make their appearance at st  james s  the whole family  in short  n    were properly overjoyed on the occasion  the younger girls formed hopes n    of  coming out  a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have n    done  and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s n    dying an old maid  charlotte herself was tolerably composed  she had n    gained her point  and had time to consider of it  her reflections were n    in general satisfactory  mr  collins  to be sure  was neither sensible n    nor agreeable  his society was irksome  and his attachment to her must n    be imaginary  but still he would be her husband  without thinking highly n    either of men or matrimony  marriage had always been her object  it was n    the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune  n    and however uncertain of giving happiness  must be their pleasantest n    preservative from want  this preservative she had now obtained  and at n    the age of twenty-seven  without having ever been handsome  she felt all n    the good luck of it  the least agreeable circumstance in the business n    was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet  whose friendship n    she valued beyond that of any other person  elizabeth would wonder  n    and probably would blame her  and though her resolution was not to be n    shaken  her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation  she resolved n    to give her the information herself  and therefore charged mr  collins  n    when he returned to longbourn to dinner  to drop no hint of what had n    passed before any of the family  a promise of secrecy was of course very n    dutifully given  but it could not be kept without difficulty  for the n    curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct n    questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade  and he was n    at the same time exercising great self-denial  for he was longing to n    publish his prosperous love  n     n    as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the n    family  the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved n    for the night  and mrs  bennet  with great politeness and cordiality  n    said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again  whenever n    his engagements might allow him to visit them  n     n     my dear madam   he replied   this invitation is particularly n    gratifying  because it is what i have been hoping to receive  and n    you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as n    possible   n     n    they were all astonished  and mr  bennet  who could by no means wish for n    so speedy a return  immediately said  n     n     but is there not danger of lady catherine  s disapprobation here  my n    good sir  you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of n    offending your patroness   n     n     my dear sir   replied mr  collins   i am particularly obliged to you n    for this friendly caution  and you may depend upon my not taking so n    material a step without her ladyship  s concurrence   n     n     you cannot be too much upon your guard  risk anything rather than her n    displeasure  and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us n    again  which i should think exceedingly probable  stay quietly at home  n    and be satisfied that  we  shall take no offence   n     n     believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such n    affectionate attention  and depend upon it  you will speedily receive n    from me a letter of thanks for this  and for every other mark of your n    regard during my stay in hertfordshire  as for my fair cousins  though n    my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary  i shall now n    take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness  not excepting my n    cousin elizabeth   n     n    with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  all of them equally n    surprised that he meditated a quick return  mrs  bennet wished to n    understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her n    younger girls  and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him  n    she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others  there was n    a solidity in his reflections which often struck her  and though by no n    means so clever as herself  she thought that if encouraged to read n    and improve himself by such an example as hers  he might become a very n    agreeable companion  but on the following morning  every hope of this n    kind was done away  miss lucas called soon after breakfast  and in a n    private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before  n     n    the possibility of mr  collins s fancying himself in love with her n    friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two  but n    that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from n    possibility as she could encourage him herself  and her astonishment was n    consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum  and n    she could not help crying out  n     n     engaged to mr  collins  my dear charlotte--impossible   n     n    the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her n    story  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a n    reproach  though  as it was no more than she expected  she soon regained n    her composure  and calmly replied  n     n     why should you be surprised  my dear eliza  do you think it incredible n    that mr  collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion  n    because he was not so happy as to succeed with you   n     n    but elizabeth had now recollected herself  and making a strong effort n    for it  was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of n    their relationship was highly grateful to her  and that she wished her n    all imaginable happiness  n     n     i see what you are feeling   replied charlotte   you must be surprised  n    very much surprised--so lately as mr  collins was wishing to marry n    you  but when you have had time to think it over  i hope you will be n    satisfied with what i have done  i am not romantic  you know  i never n    was  i ask only a comfortable home  and considering mr  collins s n    character  connection  and situation in life  i am convinced that my n    chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on n    entering the marriage state   n     n    elizabeth quietly answered  undoubtedly   and after an awkward pause  n    they returned to the rest of the family  charlotte did not stay much n    longer  and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard  n    it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so n    unsuitable a match  the strangeness of mr  collins s making two offers n    of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now n    accepted  she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was n    not exactly like her own  but she had not supposed it to be possible n    that  when called into action  she would have sacrificed every better n    feeling to worldly advantage  charlotte the wife of mr  collins was a n    most humiliating picture  and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself n    and sunk in her esteem  was added the distressing conviction that it n    was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had n    chosen  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters  reflecting on what n    she had heard  and doubting whether she was authorised to mention n    it  when sir william lucas himself appeared  sent by his daughter  to n    announce her engagement to the family  with many compliments to them  n    and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the n    houses  he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering  but n    incredulous  for mrs  bennet  with more perseverance than politeness  n    protested he must be entirely mistaken  and lydia  always unguarded and n    often uncivil  boisterously exclaimed  n     n     good lord  sir william  how can you tell such a story  do not you know n    that mr  collins wants to marry lizzy   n     n    nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne n    without anger such treatment  but sir william s good breeding carried n    him through it all  and though he begged leave to be positive as to the n    truth of his information  he listened to all their impertinence with the n    most forbearing courtesy  n     n    elizabeth  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant n    a situation  now put herself forward to confirm his account  by n    mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself  and n    endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters n    by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william  in which she n    was readily joined by jane  and by making a variety of remarks on the n    happiness that might be expected from the match  the excellent character n    of mr  collins  and the convenient distance of hunsford from london  n     n    mrs  bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while n    sir william remained  but no sooner had he left them than her feelings n    found a rapid vent  in the first place  she persisted in disbelieving n    the whole of the matter  secondly  she was very sure that mr  collins n    had been taken in  thirdly  she trusted that they would never be n    happy together  and fourthly  that the match might be broken off  two n    inferences  however  were plainly deduced from the whole  one  that n    elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief  and the other that she n    herself had been barbarously misused by them all  and on these two n    points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day  nothing could n    console and nothing could appease her  nor did that day wear out her n    resentment  a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without n    scolding her  a month passed away before she could speak to sir william n    or lady lucas without being rude  and many months were gone before she n    could at all forgive their daughter  n     n    mr  bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion  and such n    as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort  for n    it gratified him  he said  to discover that charlotte lucas  whom he had n    been used to think tolerably sensible  was as foolish as his wife  and n    more foolish than his daughter  n     n    jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  but she said n    less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness  n    nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable  kitty n    and lydia were far from envying miss lucas  for mr  collins was only a n    clergyman  and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news n    to spread at meryton  n     n    lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort n    on mrs  bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married  and she n    called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was  n    though mrs  bennet s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been n    enough to drive happiness away  n     n    between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them n    mutually silent on the subject  and elizabeth felt persuaded that n    no real confidence could ever subsist between them again  her n    disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her n    sister  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could n    never be shaken  and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious  n    as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his n    return  n     n    jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter  and was counting n    the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again  the promised n    letter of thanks from mr  collins arrived on tuesday  addressed to n    their father  and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a n    twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted  after discharging n    his conscience on that head  he proceeded to inform them  with many n    rapturous expressions  of his happiness in having obtained the affection n    of their amiable neighbour  miss lucas  and then explained that it was n    merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready n    to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn  whither n    he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight  for lady catherine  n    he added  so heartily approved his marriage  that she wished it to take n    place as soon as possible  which he trusted would be an unanswerable n    argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him n    the happiest of men  n     n    mr  collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of n    pleasure to mrs  bennet  on the contrary  she was as much disposed to n    complain of it as her husband  it was very strange that he should come n    to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge  it was also very inconvenient n    and exceedingly troublesome  she hated having visitors in the house n    while her health was so indifferent  and lovers were of all people the n    most disagreeable  such were the gentle murmurs of mrs  bennet  and n    they gave way only to the greater distress of mr  bingley s continued n    absence  n     n    neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject  day after n    day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the n    report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to n    netherfield the whole winter  a report which highly incensed mrs  n    bennet  and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous n    falsehood  n     n    even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that n    his sisters would be successful in keeping him away  unwilling as n    she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness  and so n    dishonorable to the stability of her lover  she could not prevent its n    frequently occurring  the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters n    and of his overpowering friend  assisted by the attractions of miss n    darcy and the amusements of london might be too much  she feared  for n    the strength of his attachment  n     n    as for jane   her  anxiety under this suspense was  of course  more n    painful than elizabeth s  but whatever she felt she was desirous of n    concealing  and between herself and elizabeth  therefore  the subject n    was never alluded to  but as no such delicacy restrained her mother  n    an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley  express her n    impatience for his arrival  or even require jane to confess that if he n    did not come back she would think herself very ill used  it needed n    all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable n    tranquillity  n     n    mr  collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight  but his n    reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his n    first introduction  he was too happy  however  to need much attention  n    and luckily for the others  the business of love-making relieved them n    from a great deal of his company  the chief of every day was spent by n    him at lucas lodge  and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time n    to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed  n     n    mrs  bennet was really in a most pitiable state  the very mention of n    anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour  n    and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of  the sight n    of miss lucas was odious to her  as her successor in that house  she n    regarded her with jealous abhorrence  whenever charlotte came to see n    them  she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession  and n    whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr  collins  was convinced that n    they were talking of the longbourn estate  and resolving to turn herself n    and her daughters out of the house  as soon as mr  bennet were dead  she n    complained bitterly of all this to her husband  n     n     indeed  mr  bennet   said she   it is very hard to think that charlotte n    lucas should ever be mistress of this house  that i should be forced to n    make way for  her   and live to see her take her place in it   n     n     my dear  do not give way to such gloomy thoughts  let us hope for n    better things  let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor   n     n    this was not very consoling to mrs  bennet  and therefore  instead of n    making any answer  she went on as before  n     n     i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate  if it was n    not for the entail  i should not mind it   n     n     what should not you mind   n     n     i should not mind anything at all   n     n     let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such n    insensibility   n     n     i never can be thankful  mr  bennet  for anything about the entail  how n    anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own n    daughters  i cannot understand  and all for the sake of mr  collins too  n    why should  he  have it more than anybody else   n     n     i leave it to yourself to determine   said mr  bennet  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    miss bingley s letter arrived  and put an end to doubt  the very first n    sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for n    the winter  and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had n    time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left n    the country  n     n    hope was over  entirely over  and when jane could attend to the rest n    of the letter  she found little  except the professed affection of the n    writer  that could give her any comfort  miss darcy s praise occupied n    the chief of it  her many attractions were again dwelt on  and caroline n    boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy  and ventured to predict n    the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former n    letter  she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an n    inmate of mr  darcy s house  and mentioned with raptures some plans of n    the latter with regard to new furniture  n     n    elizabeth  to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this  n    heard it in silent indignation  her heart was divided between concern n    for her sister  and resentment against all others  to caroline s n    assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy she paid no n    credit  that he was really fond of jane  she doubted no more than she n    had ever done  and much as she had always been disposed to like him  she n    could not think without anger  hardly without contempt  on that easiness n    of temper  that want of proper resolution  which now made him the slave n    of his designing friends  and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness n    to the caprice of their inclination  had his own happiness  however  n    been the only sacrifice  he might have been allowed to sport with it in n    whatever manner he thought best  but her sister s was involved in it  as n    she thought he must be sensible himself  it was a subject  in short  n    on which reflection would be long indulged  and must be unavailing  she n    could think of nothing else  and yet whether bingley s regard had really n    died away  or were suppressed by his friends  interference  whether n    he had been aware of jane s attachment  or whether it had escaped his n    observation  whatever were the case  though her opinion of him must be n    materially affected by the difference  her sister s situation remained n    the same  her peace equally wounded  n     n    a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to n    elizabeth  but at last  on mrs  bennet s leaving them together  after a n    longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master  she could n    not help saying  n     n     oh  that my dear mother had more command over herself  she can have no n    idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him  but n    i will not repine  it cannot last long  he will be forgot  and we shall n    all be as we were before   n     n    elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude  but said n    nothing  n     n     you doubt me   cried jane  slightly colouring   indeed  you have n    no reason  he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my n    acquaintance  but that is all  i have nothing either to hope or fear  n    and nothing to reproach him with  thank god  i have not  that  pain  a n    little time  therefore--i shall certainly try to get the better   n     n    with a stronger voice she soon added   i have this comfort immediately  n    that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side  and that it n    has done no harm to anyone but myself   n     n     my dear jane   exclaimed elizabeth   you are too good  your sweetness n    and disinterestedness are really angelic  i do not know what to say n    to you  i feel as if i had never done you justice  or loved you as you n    deserve   n     n    miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit  and threw back n    the praise on her sister s warm affection  n     n     nay   said elizabeth   this is not fair   you  wish to think all the n    world respectable  and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody  i only want n    to think  you  perfect  and you set yourself against it  do not n    be afraid of my running into any excess  of my encroaching on your n    privilege of universal good-will  you need not  there are few people n    whom i really love  and still fewer of whom i think well  the more i see n    of the world  the more am i dissatisfied with it  and every day confirms n    my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters  and of the n    little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or n    sense  i have met with two instances lately  one i will not mention  the n    other is charlotte s marriage  it is unaccountable  in every view it is n    unaccountable   n     n     my dear lizzy  do not give way to such feelings as these  they will n    ruin your happiness  you do not make allowance enough for difference n    of situation and temper  consider mr  collins s respectability  and n    charlotte s steady  prudent character  remember that she is one of a n    large family  that as to fortune  it is a most eligible match  and be n    ready to believe  for everybody s sake  that she may feel something like n    regard and esteem for our cousin   n     n     to oblige you  i would try to believe almost anything  but no one else n    could be benefited by such a belief as this  for were i persuaded that n    charlotte had any regard for him  i should only think worse of her n    understanding than i now do of her heart  my dear jane  mr  collins is a n    conceited  pompous  narrow-minded  silly man  you know he is  as well as n    i do  and you must feel  as well as i do  that the woman who married him n    cannot have a proper way of thinking  you shall not defend her  though n    it is charlotte lucas  you shall not  for the sake of one individual  n    change the meaning of principle and integrity  nor endeavour to persuade n    yourself or me  that selfishness is prudence  and insensibility of n    danger security for happiness   n     n     i must think your language too strong in speaking of both   replied n    jane   and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy n    together  but enough of this  you alluded to something else  you n    mentioned  two  instances  i cannot misunderstand you  but i entreat n    you  dear lizzy  not to pain me by thinking  that person  to blame  and n    saying your opinion of him is sunk  we must not be so ready to fancy n    ourselves intentionally injured  we must not expect a lively young man n    to be always so guarded and circumspect  it is very often nothing but n    our own vanity that deceives us  women fancy admiration means more than n    it does   n     n     and men take care that they should   n     n     if it is designedly done  they cannot be justified  but i have no idea n    of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine   n     n     i am far from attributing any part of mr  bingley  s conduct to design   n    said elizabeth   but without scheming to do wrong  or to make others n    unhappy  there may be error  and there may be misery  thoughtlessness  n    want of attention to other people s feelings  and want of resolution  n    will do the business   n     n     and do you impute it to either of those   n     n     yes  to the last  but if i go on  i shall displease you by saying what n    i think of persons you esteem  stop me whilst you can   n     n     you persist  then  in supposing his sisters influence him   n     n     yes  in conjunction with his friend   n     n     i cannot believe it  why should they try to influence him  they can n    only wish his happiness  and if he is attached to me  no other woman can n    secure it   n     n     your first position is false  they may wish many things besides his n    happiness  they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence  they n    may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money  great n    connections  and pride   n     n     beyond a doubt  they  do  wish him to choose miss darcy   replied jane  n     but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing  they have n    known her much longer than they have known me  no wonder if they love n    her better  but  whatever may be their own wishes  it is very unlikely n    they should have opposed their brother s  what sister would think n    herself at liberty to do it  unless there were something very n    objectionable  if they believed him attached to me  they would not try n    to part us  if he were so  they could not succeed  by supposing such an n    affection  you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong  and me most n    unhappy  do not distress me by the idea  i am not ashamed of having been n    mistaken--or  at least  it is light  it is nothing in comparison of what n    i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters  let me take it in n    the best light  in the light in which it may be understood   n     n    elizabeth could not oppose such a wish  and from this time mr  bingley s n    name was scarcely ever mentioned between them  n     n    mrs  bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no n    more  and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account n    for it clearly  there was little chance of her ever considering it with n    less perplexity  her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she n    did not believe herself  that his attentions to jane had been merely the n    effect of a common and transient liking  which ceased when he saw her n    no more  but though the probability of the statement was admitted at n    the time  she had the same story to repeat every day  mrs  bennet s best n    comfort was that mr  bingley must be down again in the summer  n     n    mr  bennet treated the matter differently   so  lizzy   said he one day  n     your sister is crossed in love  i find  i congratulate her  next to n    being married  a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then  n    it is something to think of  and it gives her a sort of distinction n    among her companions  when is your turn to come  you will hardly bear to n    be long outdone by jane  now is your time  here are officers enough in n    meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country  let wickham n    be  your  man  he is a pleasant fellow  and would jilt you creditably   n     n     thank you  sir  but a less agreeable man would satisfy me  we must not n    all expect jane  s good fortune   n     n     true   said mr  bennet   but it is a comfort to think that whatever of n    that kind may befall you  you have an affectionate mother who will make n    the most of it   n     n    mr  wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom n    which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn n    family  they saw him often  and to his other recommendations was now n    added that of general unreserve  the whole of what elizabeth had already n    heard  his claims on mr  darcy  and all that he had suffered from him  n    was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed  and everybody was n    pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr  darcy before they n    had known anything of the matter  n     n    miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be n    any extenuating circumstances in the case  unknown to the society n    of hertfordshire  her mild and steady candour always pleaded for n    allowances  and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else n    mr  darcy was condemned as the worst of men  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity  n    mr  collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of n    saturday  the pain of separation  however  might be alleviated on his n    side  by preparations for the reception of his bride  as he had reason n    to hope  that shortly after his return into hertfordshire  the day would n    be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men  he took leave of his n    relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before  wished his fair n    cousins health and happiness again  and promised their father another n    letter of thanks  n     n    on the following monday  mrs  bennet had the pleasure of receiving n    her brother and his wife  who came as usual to spend the christmas n    at longbourn  mr  gardiner was a sensible  gentlemanlike man  greatly n    superior to his sister  as well by nature as education  the netherfield n    ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived n    by trade  and within view of his own warehouses  could have been so n    well-bred and agreeable  mrs  gardiner  who was several years younger n    than mrs  bennet and mrs  phillips  was an amiable  intelligent  elegant n    woman  and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces  between the n    two eldest and herself especially  there subsisted a particular regard  n    they had frequently been staying with her in town  n     n    the first part of mrs  gardiner s business on her arrival was to n    distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions  when this was n    done she had a less active part to play  it became her turn to listen  n    mrs  bennet had many grievances to relate  and much to complain of  they n    had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister  two of her n    girls had been upon the point of marriage  and after all there was n    nothing in it  n     n     i do not blame jane   she continued   for jane would have got mr  n    bingley if she could  but lizzy  oh  sister  it is very hard to think n    that she might have been mr  collins s wife by this time  had it not n    been for her own perverseness  he made her an offer in this very room  n    and she refused him  the consequence of it is  that lady lucas will have n    a daughter married before i have  and that the longbourn estate is just n    as much entailed as ever  the lucases are very artful people indeed  n    sister  they are all for what they can get  i am sorry to say it of n    them  but so it is  it makes me very nervous and poorly  to be thwarted n    so in my own family  and to have neighbours who think of themselves n    before anybody else  however  your coming just at this time is the n    greatest of comforts  and i am very glad to hear what you tell us  of n    long sleeves   n     n    mrs  gardiner  to whom the chief of this news had been given before  n    in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her  made her n    sister a slight answer  and  in compassion to her nieces  turned the n    conversation  n     n    when alone with elizabeth afterwards  she spoke more on the subject   it n    seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane   said she   i am n    sorry it went off  but these things happen so often  a young man  such n    as you describe mr  bingley  so easily falls in love with a pretty girl n    for a few weeks  and when accident separates them  so easily forgets n    her  that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent   n     n     an excellent consolation in its way   said elizabeth   but it will not n    do for  us   we do not suffer by  accident   it does not often n    happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of n    independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in n    love with only a few days before   n     n     but that expression of   violently in love   is so hackneyed  so n    doubtful  so indefinite  that it gives me very little idea  it is as n    often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour s acquaintance  n    as to a real  strong attachment  pray  how  violent was  mr  bingley s n    love   n     n     i never saw a more promising inclination  he was growing quite n    inattentive to other people  and wholly engrossed by her  every time n    they met  it was more decided and remarkable  at his own ball he n    offended two or three young ladies  by not asking them to dance  and i n    spoke to him twice myself  without receiving an answer  could there be n    finer symptoms  is not general incivility the very essence of love   n     n     oh  yes --of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt  poor n    jane  i am sorry for her  because  with her disposition  she may not get n    over it immediately  it had better have happened to  you   lizzy  you n    would have laughed yourself out of it sooner  but do you think she n    would be prevailed upon to go back with us  change of scene might be n    of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as n    anything   n     n    elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal  and felt persuaded n    of her sister s ready acquiescence  n     n     i hope   added mrs  gardiner   that no consideration with regard to n    this young man will influence her  we live in so different a part of n    town  all our connections are so different  and  as you well know  we go n    out so little  that it is very improbable that they should meet at all  n    unless he really comes to see her   n     n     and  that  is quite impossible  for he is now in the custody of his n    friend  and mr  darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such n    a part of london  my dear aunt  how could you think of it  mr  darcy may n    perhaps have  heard  of such a place as gracechurch street  but he n    would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its n    impurities  were he once to enter it  and depend upon it  mr  bingley n    never stirs without him   n     n     so much the better  i hope they will not meet at all  but does not jane n    correspond with his sister   she  will not be able to help calling   n     n     she will drop the acquaintance entirely   n     n    but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this n    point  as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being n    withheld from seeing jane  she felt a solicitude on the subject which n    convinced her  on examination  that she did not consider it entirely n    hopeless  it was possible  and sometimes she thought it probable  that n    his affection might be reanimated  and the influence of his friends n    successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s n    attractions  n     n    miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure  and the n    bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time  than as she n    hoped by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother  n    she might occasionally spend a morning with her  without any danger of n    seeing him  n     n    the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn  and what with the phillipses  n    the lucases  and the officers  there was not a day without its n    engagement  mrs  bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment n    of her brother and sister  that they did not once sit down to a family n    dinner  when the engagement was for home  some of the officers always n    made part of it--of which officers mr  wickham was sure to be one  and n    on these occasions  mrs  gardiner  rendered suspicious by elizabeth s n    warm commendation  narrowly observed them both  without supposing them  n    from what she saw  to be very seriously in love  their preference n    of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy  and n    she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left n    hertfordshire  and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such n    an attachment  n     n    to mrs  gardiner  wickham had one means of affording pleasure  n    unconnected with his general powers  about ten or a dozen years ago  n    before her marriage  she had spent a considerable time in that very n    part of derbyshire to which he belonged  they had  therefore  many n    acquaintances in common  and though wickham had been little there since n    the death of darcy s father  it was yet in his power to give her fresher n    intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of n    procuring  n     n    mrs  gardiner had seen pemberley  and known the late mr  darcy by n    character perfectly well  here consequently was an inexhaustible subject n    of discourse  in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute n    description which wickham could give  and in bestowing her tribute of n    praise on the character of its late possessor  she was delighting both n    him and herself  on being made acquainted with the present mr  darcy s n    treatment of him  she tried to remember some of that gentleman s n    reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it  and n    was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr  fitzwilliam n    darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud  ill-natured boy  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    mrs  gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given n    on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone  after n    honestly telling her what she thought  she thus went on  n     n     you are too sensible a girl  lizzy  to fall in love merely because n    you are warned against it  and  therefore  i am not afraid of speaking n    openly  seriously  i would have you be on your guard  do not involve n    yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want n    of fortune would make so very imprudent  i have nothing to say against n     him   he is a most interesting young man  and if he had the fortune he n    ought to have  i should think you could not do better  but as it is  you n    must not let your fancy run away with you  you have sense  and we all n    expect you to use it  your father would depend on  your  resolution and n    good conduct  i am sure  you must not disappoint your father   n     n     my dear aunt  this is being serious indeed   n     n     yes  and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise   n     n     well  then  you need not be under any alarm  i will take care of n    myself  and of mr  wickham too  he shall not be in love with me  if i n    can prevent it   n     n     elizabeth  you are not serious now   n     n     i beg your pardon  i will try again  at present i am not in love with n    mr  wickham  no  i certainly am not  but he is  beyond all comparison  n    the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to n    me--i believe it will be better that he should not  i see the imprudence n    of it  oh   that  abominable mr  darcy  my father s opinion of me does n    me the greatest honour  and i should be miserable to forfeit it  my n    father  however  is partial to mr  wickham  in short  my dear aunt  i n    should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy  but n    since we see every day that where there is affection  young people n    are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into n    engagements with each other  how can i promise to be wiser than so many n    of my fellow-creatures if i am tempted  or how am i even to know that it n    would be wisdom to resist  all that i can promise you  therefore  is not n    to be in a hurry  i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first n    object  when i am in company with him  i will not be wishing  in short  n    i will do my best   n     n     perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very n    often  at least  you should not  remind  your mother of inviting him   n     n     as i did the other day   said elizabeth with a conscious smile   very n    true  it will be wise in me to refrain from  that   but do not imagine n    that he is always here so often  it is on your account that he has been n    so frequently invited this week  you know my mother s ideas as to the n    necessity of constant company for her friends  but really  and upon my n    honour  i will try to do what i think to be the wisest  and now i hope n    you are satisfied   n     n    her aunt assured her that she was  and elizabeth having thanked her for n    the kindness of her hints  they parted  a wonderful instance of advice n    being given on such a point  without being resented  n     n    mr  collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted n    by the gardiners and jane  but as he took up his abode with the lucases  n    his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs  bennet  his marriage was n    now fast approaching  and she was at length so far resigned as to think n    it inevitable  and even repeatedly to say  in an ill-natured tone  that n    she   wished  they might be happy   thursday was to be the wedding day  n    and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit  and when she n    rose to take leave  elizabeth  ashamed of her mother s ungracious and n    reluctant good wishes  and sincerely affected herself  accompanied her n    out of the room  as they went downstairs together  charlotte said  n     n     i shall depend on hearing from you very often  eliza   n     n      that  you certainly shall   n     n     and i have another favour to ask you  will you come and see me   n     n     we shall often meet  i hope  in hertfordshire   n     n     i am not likely to leave kent for some time  promise me  therefore  to n    come to hunsford   n     n    elizabeth could not refuse  though she foresaw little pleasure in the n    visit  n     n     my father and maria are coming to me in march   added charlotte   and i n    hope you will consent to be of the party  indeed  eliza  you will be as n    welcome as either of them   n     n    the wedding took place  the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from n    the church door  and everybody had as much to say  or to hear  on n    the subject as usual  elizabeth soon heard from her friend  and their n    correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been  that n    it should be equally unreserved was impossible  elizabeth could never n    address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over  n    and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent  it was for the n    sake of what had been  rather than what was  charlotte s first letters n    were received with a good deal of eagerness  there could not but be n    curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home  how she would n    like lady catherine  and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to n    be  though  when the letters were read  elizabeth felt that charlotte n    expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen  she n    wrote cheerfully  seemed surrounded with comforts  and mentioned nothing n    which she could not praise  the house  furniture  neighbourhood  and n    roads  were all to her taste  and lady catherine s behaviour was most n    friendly and obliging  it was mr  collins s picture of hunsford and n    rosings rationally softened  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait n    for her own visit there to know the rest  n     n    jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their n    safe arrival in london  and when she wrote again  elizabeth hoped it n    would be in her power to say something of the bingleys  n     n    her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience n    generally is  jane had been a week in town without either seeing or n    hearing from caroline  she accounted for it  however  by supposing that n    her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been n    lost  n     n     my aunt   she continued   is going to-morrow into that part of the n    town  and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street   n     n    she wrote again when the visit was paid  and she had seen miss bingley  n     i did not think caroline in spirits   were her words   but she was very n    glad to see me  and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming n    to london  i was right  therefore  my last letter had never reached n    her  i inquired after their brother  of course  he was well  but so much n    engaged with mr  darcy that they scarcely ever saw him  i found that n    miss darcy was expected to dinner  i wish i could see her  my visit was n    not long  as caroline and mrs  hurst were going out  i dare say i shall n    see them soon here   n     n    elizabeth shook her head over this letter  it convinced her that n    accident only could discover to mr  bingley her sister s being in town  n     n    four weeks passed away  and jane saw nothing of him  she endeavoured to n    persuade herself that she did not regret it  but she could no longer be n    blind to miss bingley s inattention  after waiting at home every morning n    for a fortnight  and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her  the n    visitor did at last appear  but the shortness of her stay  and yet more  n    the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no n    longer  the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will n    prove what she felt  n     n     my dearest lizzy will  i am sure  be incapable of triumphing in her n    better judgement  at my expense  when i confess myself to have been n    entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me  but  my dear sister  n    though the event has proved you right  do not think me obstinate if i n    still assert that  considering what her behaviour was  my confidence was n    as natural as your suspicion  i do not at all comprehend her reason for n    wishing to be intimate with me  but if the same circumstances were to n    happen again  i am sure i should be deceived again  caroline did not n    return my visit till yesterday  and not a note  not a line  did i n    receive in the meantime  when she did come  it was very evident that n    she had no pleasure in it  she made a slight  formal apology  for not n    calling before  said not a word of wishing to see me again  and was n    in every respect so altered a creature  that when she went away i was n    perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer  i pity  n    though i cannot help blaming her  she was very wrong in singling me out n    as she did  i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on n    her side  but i pity her  because she must feel that she has been acting n    wrong  and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the n    cause of it  i need not explain myself farther  and though  we  know n    this anxiety to be quite needless  yet if she feels it  it will easily n    account for her behaviour to me  and so deservedly dear as he is to n    his sister  whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and n    amiable  i cannot but wonder  however  at her having any such fears now  n    because  if he had at all cared about me  we must have met  long ago  n    he knows of my being in town  i am certain  from something she said n    herself  and yet it would seem  by her manner of talking  as if she n    wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy  i n    cannot understand it  if i were not afraid of judging harshly  i should n    be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity n    in all this  but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought  n    and think only of what will make me happy--your affection  and the n    invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt  let me hear from you very n    soon  miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield n    again  of giving up the house  but not with any certainty  we had better n    not mention it  i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts n    from our friends at hunsford  pray go to see them  with sir william and n    maria  i am sure you will be very comfortable there --yours  etc   n     n    this letter gave elizabeth some pain  but her spirits returned as she n    considered that jane would no longer be duped  by the sister at least  n    all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over  she would not n    even wish for a renewal of his attentions  his character sunk on n    every review of it  and as a punishment for him  as well as a possible n    advantage to jane  she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr  n    darcy s sister  as by wickham s account  she would make him abundantly n    regret what he had thrown away  n     n    mrs  gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise n    concerning that gentleman  and required information  and elizabeth n    had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to n    herself  his apparent partiality had subsided  his attentions were over  n    he was the admirer of some one else  elizabeth was watchful enough to n    see it all  but she could see it and write of it without material pain  n    her heart had been but slightly touched  and her vanity was satisfied n    with believing that  she  would have been his only choice  had fortune n    permitted it  the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most n    remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself n    agreeable  but elizabeth  less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than n    in charlotte s  did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence  n    nothing  on the contrary  could be more natural  and while able to n    suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her  she was n    ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both  and could very n    sincerely wish him happy  n     n    all this was acknowledged to mrs  gardiner  and after relating the n    circumstances  she thus went on   i am now convinced  my dear aunt  that n    i have never been much in love  for had i really experienced that pure n    and elevating passion  i should at present detest his very name  and n    wish him all manner of evil  but my feelings are not only cordial n    towards  him   they are even impartial towards miss king  i cannot find n    out that i hate her at all  or that i am in the least unwilling to n    think her a very good sort of girl  there can be no love in all this  my n    watchfulness has been effectual  and though i certainly should be a more n    interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love n    with him  i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance  n    importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly  kitty and lydia take n    his defection much more to heart than i do  they are young in the n    ways of the world

to take n    elizabeth to hunsford  she had not at first thought very seriously of n    going thither  but charlotte  she soon found  was depending on the plan n    and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure n    as well as greater certainty  absence had increased her desire of seeing n    charlotte again  and weakened her disgust of mr  collins  there n    was novelty in the scheme  and as  with such a mother and such n    uncompanionable sisters  home could not be faultless  a little change n    was not unwelcome for its own sake  the journey would moreover give her n    a peep at jane  and  in short  as the time drew near  she would have n    been very sorry for any delay  everything  however  went on smoothly  n    and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch  she was n    to accompany sir william and his second daughter  the improvement n    of spending a night in london was added in time  and the plan became n    perfect as plan could be  n     n    the only pain was in leaving her father  who would certainly miss her  n    and who  when it came to the point  so little liked her going  that he n    told her to write to him  and almost promised to answer her letter  n     n    the farewell between herself and mr  wickham was perfectly friendly  on n    his side even more  his present pursuit could not make him forget that n    elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention  the n    first to listen and to pity  the first to be admired  and in his manner n    of bidding her adieu  wishing her every enjoyment  reminding her of n    what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh  and trusting their n    opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide  there n    was a solicitude  an interest which she felt must ever attach her to n    him with a most sincere regard  and she parted from him convinced that  n    whether married or single  he must always be her model of the amiable n    and pleasing  n     n    her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her n    think him less agreeable  sir william lucas  and his daughter maria  a n    good-humoured girl  but as empty-headed as himself  had nothing to say n    that could be worth hearing  and were listened to with about as much n    delight as the rattle of the chaise  elizabeth loved absurdities  but n    she had known sir william s too long  he could tell her nothing new of n    the wonders of his presentation and knighthood  and his civilities were n    worn out  like his information  n     n    it was a journey of only twenty-four miles  and they began it so early n    as to be in gracechurch street by noon  as they drove to mr  gardiner s n    door  jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival  when n    they entered the passage she was there to welcome them  and elizabeth  n    looking earnestly in her face  was pleased to see it healthful and n    lovely as ever  on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls  n    whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to n    wait in the drawing-room  and whose shyness  as they had not seen n    her for a twelvemonth  prevented their coming lower  all was joy and n    kindness  the day passed most pleasantly away  the morning in bustle and n    shopping  and the evening at one of the theatres  n     n    elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt  their first object was her n    sister  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear  in reply to n    her minute inquiries  that though jane always struggled to support her n    spirits  there were periods of dejection  it was reasonable  however  n    to hope that they would not continue long  mrs  gardiner gave her the n    particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street  and n    repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and n    herself  which proved that the former had  from her heart  given up the n    acquaintance  n     n    mrs  gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion  and n    complimented her on bearing it so well  n     n     but my dear elizabeth   she added   what sort of girl is miss king  i n    should be sorry to think our friend mercenary   n     n     pray  my dear aunt  what is the difference in matrimonial affairs  n    between the mercenary and the prudent motive  where does discretion end  n    and avarice begin  last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me  n    because it would be imprudent  and now  because he is trying to get n    a girl with only ten thousand pounds  you want to find out that he is n    mercenary   n     n     if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is  i shall know n    what to think   n     n     she is a very good kind of girl  i believe  i know no harm of her   n     n     but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather  s death n    made her mistress of this fortune   n     n     no--why should he  if it were not allowable for him to gain  my  n    affections because i had no money  what occasion could there be for n    making love to a girl whom he did not care about  and who was equally n    poor   n     n     but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her n    so soon after this event   n     n     a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant n    decorums which other people may observe  if  she  does not object to it  n    why should  we    n     n      her  not objecting does not justify  him   it only shows her being n    deficient in something herself--sense or feeling   n     n     well   cried elizabeth   have it as you choose   he  shall be n    mercenary  and  she  shall be foolish   n     n     no  lizzy  that is what i do  not  choose  i should be sorry  you know  n    to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire   n     n     oh  if that is all  i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in n    derbyshire  and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not n    much better  i am sick of them all  thank heaven  i am going to-morrow n    where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality  who has n    neither manner nor sense to recommend him  stupid men are the only ones n    worth knowing  after all   n     n     take care  lizzy  that speech savours strongly of disappointment   n     n    before they were separated by the conclusion of the play  she had the n    unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in n    a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer  n     n     we have not determined how far it shall carry us   said mrs  gardiner  n     but  perhaps  to the lakes   n     n    no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth  and her n    acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful   oh  my dear  n    dear aunt   she rapturously cried   what delight  what felicity  you n    give me fresh life and vigour  adieu to disappointment and spleen  what n    are young men to rocks and mountains  oh  what hours of transport n    we shall spend  and when we  do  return  it shall not be like other n    travellers  without being able to give one accurate idea of anything  we n     will  know where we have gone--we  will  recollect what we have seen  n    lakes  mountains  and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our n    imaginations  nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene  n    will we begin quarreling about its relative situation  let  our  n    first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of n    travellers   n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to n    elizabeth  and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment  for she had n    seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health  n    and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight  n     n    when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford  every eye was in n    search of the parsonage  and every turning expected to bring it in view  n    the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side  elizabeth n    smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants  n     n    at length the parsonage was discernible  the garden sloping to the n    road  the house standing in it  the green pales  and the laurel hedge  n    everything declared they were arriving  mr  collins and charlotte n    appeared at the door  and the carriage stopped at the small gate which n    led by a short gravel walk to the house  amidst the nods and smiles of n    the whole party  in a moment they were all out of the chaise  rejoicing n    at the sight of each other  mrs  collins welcomed her friend with the n    liveliest pleasure  and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with n    coming when she found herself so affectionately received  she saw n    instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage  n    his formal civility was just what it had been  and he detained her some n    minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her n    family  they were then  with no other delay than his pointing out the n    neatness of the entrance  taken into the house  and as soon as they n    were in the parlour  he welcomed them a second time  with ostentatious n    formality to his humble abode  and punctually repeated all his wife s n    offers of refreshment  n     n    elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory  and she could not help n    in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room  its n    aspect and its furniture  he addressed himself particularly to her  n    as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him  but n    though everything seemed neat and comfortable  she was not able to n    gratify him by any sigh of repentance  and rather looked with wonder at n    her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion  n    when mr  collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be n    ashamed  which certainly was not unseldom  she involuntarily turned her n    eye on charlotte  once or twice she could discern a faint blush  but n    in general charlotte wisely did not hear  after sitting long enough to n    admire every article of furniture in the room  from the sideboard to n    the fender  to give an account of their journey  and of all that had n    happened in london  mr  collins invited them to take a stroll in the n    garden  which was large and well laid out  and to the cultivation of n    which he attended himself  to work in this garden was one of his most n    respectable pleasures  and elizabeth admired the command of countenance n    with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise  and n    owned she encouraged it as much as possible  here  leading the way n    through every walk and cross walk  and scarcely allowing them an n    interval to utter the praises he asked for  every view was pointed out n    with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind  he could number the n    fields in every direction  and could tell how many trees there were in n    the most distant clump  but of all the views which his garden  or which n    the country or kingdom could boast  none were to be compared with the n    prospect of rosings  afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered n    the park nearly opposite the front of his house  it was a handsome n    modern building  well situated on rising ground  n     n    from his garden  mr  collins would have led them round his two meadows  n    but the ladies  not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white n    frost  turned back  and while sir william accompanied him  charlotte n    took her sister and friend over the house  extremely well pleased  n    probably  to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband s n    help  it was rather small  but well built and convenient  and everything n    was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which n    elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit  when mr  collins could be n    forgotten  there was really an air of great comfort throughout  and by n    charlotte s evident enjoyment of it  elizabeth supposed he must be often n    forgotten  n     n    she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country  it n    was spoken of again while they were at dinner  when mr  collins joining n    in  observed  n     n     yes  miss elizabeth  you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine n    de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church  and i need not say you will n    be delighted with her  she is all affability and condescension  and i n    doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice n    when service is over  i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she n    will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she n    honours us during your stay here  her behaviour to my dear charlotte is n    charming  we dine at rosings twice every week  and are never allowed n    to walk home  her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us  i n     should  say  one of her ladyship  s carriages  for she has several   n     n     lady catherine is a very respectable  sensible woman indeed   added n    charlotte   and a most attentive neighbour   n     n     very true  my dear  that is exactly what i say  she is the sort of n    woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference   n     n    the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news  n    and telling again what had already been written  and when it closed  n    elizabeth  in the solitude of her chamber  had to meditate upon n    charlotte s degree of contentment  to understand her address in guiding  n    and composure in bearing with  her husband  and to acknowledge that it n    was all done very well  she had also to anticipate how her visit n    would pass  the quiet tenor of their usual employments  the vexatious n    interruptions of mr  collins  and the gaieties of their intercourse with n    rosings  a lively imagination soon settled it all  n     n    about the middle of the next day  as she was in her room getting ready n    for a walk  a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in n    confusion  and  after listening a moment  she heard somebody running n    up stairs in a violent hurry  and calling loudly after her  she opened n    the door and met maria in the landing place  who  breathless with n    agitation  cried out-- n     n     oh  my dear eliza  pray make haste and come into the dining-room  for n    there is such a sight to be seen  i will not tell you what it is  make n    haste  and come down this moment   n     n    elizabeth asked questions in vain  maria would tell her nothing more  n    and down they ran into the dining-room  which fronted the lane  in n    quest of this wonder  it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the n    garden gate  n     n     and is this all   cried elizabeth   i expected at least that the pigs n    were got into the garden  and here is nothing but lady catherine and her n    daughter   n     n     la  my dear   said maria  quite shocked at the mistake   it is not n    lady catherine  the old lady is mrs  jenkinson  who lives with them  n    the other is miss de bourgh  only look at her  she is quite a little n    creature  who would have thought that she could be so thin and small   n     n     she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind  n    why does she not come in   n     n     oh  charlotte says she hardly ever does  it is the greatest of favours n    when miss de bourgh comes in   n     n     i like her appearance   said elizabeth  struck with other ideas   she n    looks sickly and cross  yes  she will do for him very well  she will n    make him a very proper wife   n     n    mr  collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation n    with the ladies  and sir william  to elizabeth s high diversion  was n    stationed in the doorway  in earnest contemplation of the greatness n    before him  and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that n    way  n     n    at length there was nothing more to be said  the ladies drove on  and n    the others returned into the house  mr  collins no sooner saw the two n    girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune  which n    charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked n    to dine at rosings the next day  n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    mr  collins s triumph  in consequence of this invitation  was complete  n    the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering n    visitors  and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his n    wife  was exactly what he had wished for  and that an opportunity n    of doing it should be given so soon  was such an instance of lady n    catherine s condescension  as he knew not how to admire enough  n     n     i confess   said he   that i should not have been at all surprised by n    her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at n    rosings  i rather expected  from my knowledge of her affability  that it n    would happen  but who could have foreseen such an attention as this  who n    could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there n     an invitation  moreover  including the whole party  so immediately n    after your arrival   n     n     i am the less surprised at what has happened   replied sir william  n     from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are  which n    my situation in life has allowed me to acquire  about the court  such n    instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon   n     n    scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their n    visit to rosings  mr  collins was carefully instructing them in what n    they were to expect  that the sight of such rooms  so many servants  and n    so splendid a dinner  might not wholly overpower them  n     n    when the ladies were separating for the toilette  he said to elizabeth-- n     n     do not make yourself uneasy  my dear cousin  about your apparel  lady n    catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which n    becomes herself and her daughter  i would advise you merely to put on n    whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion n    for anything more  lady catherine will not think the worse of you n    for being simply dressed  she likes to have the distinction of rank n    preserved   n     n    while they were dressing  he came two or three times to their different n    doors  to recommend their being quick  as lady catherine very much n    objected to be kept waiting for her dinner  such formidable accounts of n    her ladyship  and her manner of living  quite frightened maria lucas n    who had been little used to company  and she looked forward to her n    introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done n    to his presentation at st  james s  n     n    as the weather was fine  they had a pleasant walk of about half a n    mile across the park  every park has its beauty and its prospects  and n    elizabeth saw much to be pleased with  though she could not be in such n    raptures as mr  collins expected the scene to inspire  and was but n    slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the n    house  and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally n    cost sir lewis de bourgh  n     n    when they ascended the steps to the hall  maria s alarm was every n    moment increasing  and even sir william did not look perfectly calm  n    elizabeth s courage did not fail her  she had heard nothing of lady n    catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or n    miraculous virtue  and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought n    she could witness without trepidation  n     n    from the entrance-hall  of which mr  collins pointed out  with a n    rapturous air  the fine proportion and the finished ornaments  they n    followed the servants through an ante-chamber  to the room where lady n    catherine  her daughter  and mrs  jenkinson were sitting  her ladyship  n    with great condescension  arose to receive them  and as mrs  collins had n    settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should n    be hers  it was performed in a proper manner  without any of those n    apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary  n     n    in spite of having been at st  james s  sir william was so completely n    awed by the grandeur surrounding him  that he had but just courage n    enough to make a very low bow  and take his seat without saying a word  n    and his daughter  frightened almost out of her senses  sat on the edge n    of her chair  not knowing which way to look  elizabeth found herself n    quite equal to the scene  and could observe the three ladies before her n    composedly  lady catherine was a tall  large woman  with strongly-marked n    features  which might once have been handsome  her air was not n    conciliating  nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her n    visitors forget their inferior rank  she was not rendered formidable by n    silence  but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone  n    as marked her self-importance  and brought mr  wickham immediately to n    elizabeth s mind  and from the observation of the day altogether  she n    believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented  n     n    when  after examining the mother  in whose countenance and deportment n    she soon found some resemblance of mr  darcy  she turned her eyes on the n    daughter  she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her n    being so thin and so small  there was neither in figure nor face any n    likeness between the ladies  miss de bourgh was pale and sickly  her n    features  though not plain  were insignificant  and she spoke very n    little  except in a low voice  to mrs  jenkinson  in whose appearance n    there was nothing remarkable  and who was entirely engaged in listening n    to what she said  and placing a screen in the proper direction before n    her eyes  n     n    after sitting a few minutes  they were all sent to one of the windows to n    admire the view  mr  collins attending them to point out its beauties  n    and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth n    looking at in the summer  n     n    the dinner was exceedingly handsome  and there were all the servants and n    all the articles of plate which mr  collins had promised  and  as he had n    likewise foretold  he took his seat at the bottom of the table  by her n    ladyship s desire  and looked as if he felt that life could furnish n    nothing greater  he carved  and ate  and praised with delighted n    alacrity  and every dish was commended  first by him and then by sir n    william  who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law n    said  in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear  n    but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration  and n    gave most gracious smiles  especially when any dish on the table proved n    a novelty to them  the party did not supply much conversation  elizabeth n    was ready to speak whenever there was an opening  but she was seated n    between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in n    listening to lady catherine  and the latter said not a word to her all n    dinner-time  mrs  jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little n    miss de bourgh ate  pressing her to try some other dish  and fearing n    she was indisposed  maria thought speaking out of the question  and the n    gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire  n     n    when the ladies returned to the drawing-room  there was little to n    be done but to hear lady catherine talk  which she did without any n    intermission till coffee came in  delivering her opinion on every n    subject in so decisive a manner  as proved that she was not used to n    have her judgement controverted  she inquired into charlotte s domestic n    concerns familiarly and minutely  gave her a great deal of advice as n    to the management of them all  told her how everything ought to be n    regulated in so small a family as hers  and instructed her as to the n    care of her cows and her poultry  elizabeth found that nothing was n    beneath this great lady s attention  which could furnish her with an n    occasion of dictating to others  in the intervals of her discourse n    with mrs  collins  she addressed a variety of questions to maria and n    elizabeth  but especially to the latter  of whose connections she knew n    the least  and who she observed to mrs  collins was a very genteel  n    pretty kind of girl  she asked her  at different times  how many sisters n    she had  whether they were older or younger than herself  whether any of n    them were likely to be married  whether they were handsome  where they n    had been educated  what carriage her father kept  and what had been n    her mother s maiden name  elizabeth felt all the impertinence of n    her questions but answered them very composedly  lady catherine then n    observed  n     n     your father  s estate is entailed on mr  collins  i think  for your n    sake   turning to charlotte   i am glad of it  but otherwise i see no n    occasion for entailing estates from the female line  it was not thought n    necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family  do you play and sing  miss n    bennet   n     n     a little   n     n     oh  then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you  our n    instrument is a capital one  probably superior to----you shall try it n    some day  do your sisters play and sing   n     n     one of them does   n     n     why did not you all learn  you ought all to have learned  the miss n    webbs all play  and their father has not so good an income as yours  do n    you draw   n     n     no  not at all   n     n     what  none of you   n     n     not one   n     n     that is very strange  but i suppose you had no opportunity  your mother n    should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters   n     n     my mother would have had no objection  but my father hates london   n     n     has your governess left you   n     n     we never had any governess   n     n     no governess  how was that possible  five daughters brought up at home n    without a governess  i never heard of such a thing  your mother must n    have been quite a slave to your education   n     n    elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been n    the case  n     n     then  who taught you  who attended to you  without a governess  you n    must have been neglected   n     n     compared with some families  i believe we were  but such of us as n    wished to learn never wanted the means  we were always encouraged to n    read  and had all the masters that were necessary  those who chose to be n    idle  certainly might   n     n     aye  no doubt  but that is what a governess will prevent  and if i had n    known your mother  i should have advised her most strenuously to engage n    one  i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady n    and regular instruction  and nobody but a governess can give it  it is n    wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that n    way  i am always glad to get a young person well placed out  four nieces n    of mrs  jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means  and n    it was but the other day that i recommended another young person  n    who was merely accidentally mentioned to me  and the family are quite n    delighted with her  mrs  collins  did i tell you of lady metcalf s n    calling yesterday to thank me  she finds miss pope a treasure   lady n    catherine   said she   you have given me a treasure   are any of your n    younger sisters out  miss bennet   n     n     yes  ma  am  all   n     n     all  what  all five out at once  very odd  and you only the second  the n    younger ones out before the elder ones are married  your younger sisters n    must be very young   n     n     yes  my youngest is not sixteen  perhaps  she  is full young to be n    much in company  but really  ma am  i think it would be very hard upon n    younger sisters  that they should not have their share of society and n    amusement  because the elder may not have the means or inclination to n    marry early  the last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth n    as the first  and to be kept back on  such  a motive  i think it would n    not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind   n     n     upon my word   said her ladyship   you give your opinion very decidedly n    for so young a person  pray  what is your age   n     n     with three younger sisters grown up   replied elizabeth  smiling   your n    ladyship can hardly expect me to own it   n     n    lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer  n    and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever n    dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence  n     n     you cannot be more than twenty  i am sure  therefore you need not n    conceal your age   n     n     i am not one-and-twenty   n     n    when the gentlemen had joined them  and tea was over  the card-tables n    were placed  lady catherine  sir william  and mr  and mrs  collins sat n    down to quadrille  and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino  the n    two girls had the honour of assisting mrs  jenkinson to make up her n    party  their table was superlatively stupid  scarcely a syllable was n    uttered that did not relate to the game  except when mrs  jenkinson n    expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold  or n    having too much or too little light  a great deal more passed at the n    other table  lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes n    of the three others  or relating some anecdote of herself  mr  collins n    was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said  thanking her n    for every fish he won  and apologising if he thought he won too many  n    sir william did not say much  he was storing his memory with anecdotes n    and noble names  n     n    when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose  n    the tables were broken up  the carriage was offered to mrs  collins  n    gratefully accepted and immediately ordered  the party then gathered n    round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were n    to have on the morrow  from these instructions they were summoned by n    the arrival of the coach  and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr  n    collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed  as soon n    as they had driven from the door  elizabeth was called on by her cousin n    to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings  which  for n    charlotte s sake  she made more favourable than it really was  but her n    commendation  though costing her some trouble  could by no means satisfy n    mr  collins  and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise n    into his own hands  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    sir william stayed only a week at hunsford  but his visit was long n    enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled  n    and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not n    often met with  while sir william was with them  mr  collins devoted his n    morning to driving him out in his gig  and showing him the country  but n    when he went away  the whole family returned to their usual employments  n    and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her n    cousin by the alteration  for the chief of the time between breakfast n    and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in n    reading and writing  and looking out of the window in his own book-room  n    which fronted the road  the room in which the ladies sat was backwards  n    elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer n    the dining-parlour for common use  it was a better sized room  and had a n    more pleasant aspect  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent n    reason for what she did  for mr  collins would undoubtedly have been n    much less in his own apartment  had they sat in one equally lively  and n    she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement  n     n    from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane  and n    were indebted to mr  collins for the knowledge of what carriages went n    along  and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton  n    which he never failed coming to inform them of  though it happened n    almost every day  she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage  and n    had a few minutes  conversation with charlotte  but was scarcely ever n    prevailed upon to get out  n     n    very few days passed in which mr  collins did not walk to rosings  and n    not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise  n    and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings n    to be disposed of  she could not understand the sacrifice of so many n    hours  now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship  n    and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during n    these visits  she examined into their employments  looked at their work  n    and advised them to do it differently  found fault with the arrangement n    of the furniture  or detected the housemaid in negligence  and if she n    accepted any refreshment  seemed to do it only for the sake of finding n    out that mrs  collins s joints of meat were too large for her family  n     n    elizabeth soon perceived  that though this great lady was not in n    commission of the peace of the county  she was a most active magistrate n    in her own parish  the minutest concerns of which were carried to her n    by mr  collins  and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to n    be quarrelsome  discontented  or too poor  she sallied forth into the n    village to settle their differences  silence their complaints  and scold n    them into harmony and plenty  n     n    the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week  n    and  allowing for the loss of sir william  and there being only one n    card-table in the evening  every such entertainment was the counterpart n    of the first  their other engagements were few  as the style of living n    in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr  collins s reach  this  n    however  was no evil to elizabeth  and upon the whole she spent her time n    comfortably enough  there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with n    charlotte  and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had n    often great enjoyment out of doors  her favourite walk  and where she n    frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine  was n    along the open grove which edged that side of the park  where there was n    a nice sheltered path  which no one seemed to value but herself  and n    where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity  n     n    in this quiet way  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away  n    easter was approaching  and the week preceding it was to bring an n    addition to the family at rosings  which in so small a circle must be n    important  elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr  darcy was n    expected there in the course of a few weeks  and though there were not n    many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer  his coming would n    furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties  and n    she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him n    were  by his behaviour to his cousin  for whom he was evidently n    destined by lady catherine  who talked of his coming with the greatest n    satisfaction  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration  and n    seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by n    miss lucas and herself  n     n    his arrival was soon known at the parsonage  for mr  collins was walking n    the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane  n    in order to have the earliest assurance of it  and after making his n    bow as the carriage turned into the park  hurried home with the great n    intelligence  on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his n    respects  there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them  for n    mr  darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam  the younger son of n    his uncle lord ----  and  to the great surprise of all the party  when n    mr  collins returned  the gentlemen accompanied him  charlotte had seen n    them from her husband s room  crossing the road  and immediately running n    into the other  told the girls what an honour they might expect  adding  n     n     i may thank you  eliza  for this piece of civility  mr  darcy would n    never have come so soon to wait upon me   n     n    elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment  n    before their approach was announced by the door-bell  and shortly n    afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room  colonel fitzwilliam  n    who led the way  was about thirty  not handsome  but in person and n    address most truly the gentleman  mr  darcy looked just as he had been n    used to look in hertfordshire--paid his compliments  with his usual n    reserve  to mrs  collins  and whatever might be his feelings toward her n    friend  met her with every appearance of composure  elizabeth merely n    curtseyed to him without saying a word  n     n    colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the n    readiness and ease of a well-bred man  and talked very pleasantly  but n    his cousin  after having addressed a slight observation on the house and n    garden to mrs  collins  sat for some time without speaking to anybody  n    at length  however  his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of n    elizabeth after the health of her family  she answered him in the usual n    way  and after a moment s pause  added  n     n     my eldest sister has been in town these three months  have you never n    happened to see her there   n     n    she was perfectly sensible that he never had  but she wished to see n    whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between n    the bingleys and jane  and she thought he looked a little confused as he n    answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet  the n    subject was pursued no farther  and the gentlemen soon afterwards went n    away  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage  n    and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures n    of their engagements at rosings  it was some days  however  before they n    received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the n    house  they could not be necessary  and it was not till easter-day  n    almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival  that they were honoured by n    such an attention  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to n    come there in the evening  for the last week they had seen very little n    of lady catherine or her daughter  colonel fitzwilliam had called at the n    parsonage more than once during the time  but mr  darcy they had seen n    only at church  n     n    the invitation was accepted of course  and at a proper hour they joined n    the party in lady catherine s drawing-room  her ladyship received n    them civilly  but it was plain that their company was by no means so n    acceptable as when she could get nobody else  and she was  in fact  n    almost engrossed by her nephews  speaking to them  especially to darcy  n    much more than to any other person in the room  n     n    colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them  anything was a n    welcome relief to him at rosings  and mrs  collins s pretty friend had n    moreover caught his fancy very much  he now seated himself by her  and n    talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire  of travelling and staying n    at home  of new books and music  that elizabeth had never been half so n    well entertained in that room before  and they conversed with so much n    spirit and flow  as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself  n    as well as of mr  darcy   his  eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned n    towards them with a look of curiosity  and that her ladyship  after a n    while  shared the feeling  was more openly acknowledged  for she did not n    scruple to call out  n     n     what is that you are saying  fitzwilliam  what is it you are talking n    of  what are you telling miss bennet  let me hear what it is   n     n     we are speaking of music  madam   said he  when no longer able to avoid n    a reply  n     n     of music  then pray speak aloud  it is of all subjects my delight  i n    must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music  n    there are few people in england  i suppose  who have more true enjoyment n    of music than myself  or a better natural taste  if i had ever learnt  n    i should have been a great proficient  and so would anne  if her health n    had allowed her to apply  i am confident that she would have performed n    delightfully  how does georgiana get on  darcy   n     n    mr  darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency  n     n     i am very glad to hear such a good account of her   said lady n    catherine   and pray tell her from me  that she cannot expect to excel n    if she does not practice a good deal   n     n     i assure you  madam   he replied   that she does not need such advice  n    she practises very constantly   n     n     so much the better  it cannot be done too much  and when i next write n    to her  i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account  i often n    tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without n    constant practice  i have told miss bennet several times  that she n    will never play really well unless she practises more  and though mrs  n    collins has no instrument  she is very welcome  as i have often told n    her  to come to rosings every day  and play on the pianoforte in mrs  n    jenkinson s room  she would be in nobody s way  you know  in that part n    of the house   n     n    mr  darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill-breeding  and made n    no answer  n     n    when coffee was over  colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having n    promised to play to him  and she sat down directly to the instrument  he n    drew a chair near her  lady catherine listened to half a song  and then n    talked  as before  to her other nephew  till the latter walked away n    from her  and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte n    stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s n    countenance  elizabeth saw what he was doing  and at the first n    convenient pause  turned to him with an arch smile  and said  n     n     you mean to frighten me  mr  darcy  by coming in all this state to hear n    me  i will not be alarmed though your sister  does  play so well  there n    is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the n    will of others  my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate n    me   n     n     i shall not say you are mistaken   he replied   because you could not n    really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you  and i have n    had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find n    great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are n    not your own   n     n    elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself  and said to n    colonel fitzwilliam   your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of n    me  and teach you not to believe a word i say  i am particularly unlucky n    in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character  in a part n    of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of n    credit  indeed  mr  darcy  it is very ungenerous in you to mention all n    that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and  give me leave to n    say  very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such n    things may come out as will shock your relations to hear   n     n     i am not afraid of you   said he  smilingly  n     n     pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of   cried colonel n    fitzwilliam   i should like to know how he behaves among strangers   n     n     you shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful  n    the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire  you must know  n    was at a ball--and at this ball  what do you think he did  he danced n    only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce  and  to my certain n    knowledge  more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a n    partner  mr  darcy  you cannot deny the fact   n     n     i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly n    beyond my own party   n     n     true  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room  well  colonel n    fitzwilliam  what do i play next  my fingers wait your orders   n     n     perhaps   said darcy   i should have judged better  had i sought an n    introduction  but i am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers   n     n     shall we ask your cousin the reason of this   said elizabeth  still n    addressing colonel fitzwilliam   shall we ask him why a man of sense and n    education  and who has lived in the world  is ill qualified to recommend n    himself to strangers   n     n     i can answer your question   said fitzwilliam   without applying to n    him  it is because he will not give himself the trouble   n     n     i certainly have not the talent which some people possess   said darcy  n     of conversing easily with those i have never seen before  i cannot n    catch their tone of conversation  or appear interested in their n    concerns  as i often see done   n     n     my fingers   said elizabeth   do not move over this instrument in the n    masterly manner which i see so many women s do  they have not the same n    force or rapidity  and do not produce the same expression  but then i n    have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i will not take the n    trouble of practising  it is not that i do not believe  my  fingers as n    capable as any other woman  s of superior execution   n     n    darcy smiled and said   you are perfectly right  you have employed your n    time much better  no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can n    think anything wanting  we neither of us perform to strangers   n     n    here they were interrupted by lady catherine  who called out to know n    what they were talking of  elizabeth immediately began playing again  n    lady catherine approached  and  after listening for a few minutes  said n    to darcy  n     n     miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more  and n    could have the advantage of a london master  she has a very good notion n    of fingering  though her taste is not equal to anne s  anne would have n    been a delightful performer  had her health allowed her to learn   n     n    elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his n    cousin s praise  but neither at that moment nor at any other could she n    discern any symptom of love  and from the whole of his behaviour to miss n    de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley  that he might have n    been just as likely to marry  her   had she been his relation  n     n    lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance  mixing n    with them many instructions on execution and taste  elizabeth received n    them with all the forbearance of civility  and  at the request of the n    gentlemen  remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was n    ready to take them all home  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning  and writing to jane n    while mrs  collins and maria were gone on business into the village  n    when she was startled by a ring at the door  the certain signal of a n    visitor  as she had heard no carriage  she thought it not unlikely to n    be lady catherine  and under that apprehension was putting away her n    half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions  n    when the door opened  and  to her very great surprise  mr  darcy  and n    mr  darcy only  entered the room  n     n    he seemed astonished too on finding her alone  and apologised for his n    intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were n    to be within  n     n    they then sat down  and when her inquiries after rosings were made  n    seemed in danger of sinking into total silence  it was absolutely n    necessary  therefore  to think of something  and in this emergence n    recollecting  when  she had seen him last in hertfordshire  and n    feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty n    departure  she observed  n     n     how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november  mr  darcy  n    it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr  bingley to see you n    all after him so soon  for  if i recollect right  he went but the day n    before  he and his sisters were well  i hope  when you left london   n     n     perfectly so  i thank you   n     n    she found that she was to receive no other answer  and  after a short n    pause added  n     n     i think i have understood that mr  bingley has not much idea of ever n    returning to netherfield again   n     n     i have never heard him say so  but it is probable that he may spend n    very little of his time there in the future  he has many friends  and n    is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually n    increasing   n     n     if he means to be but little at netherfield  it would be better for n    the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely  for then we n    might possibly get a settled family there  but  perhaps  mr  bingley did n    not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as n    for his own  and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same n    principle   n     n     i should not be surprised   said darcy   if he were to give it up as n    soon as any eligible purchase offers   n     n    elizabeth made no answer  she was afraid of talking longer of his n    friend  and  having nothing else to say  was now determined to leave the n    trouble of finding a subject to him  n     n    he took the hint  and soon began with   this seems a very comfortable n    house  lady catherine  i believe  did a great deal to it when mr  n    collins first came to hunsford   n     n     i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her n    kindness on a more grateful object   n     n     mr  collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife   n     n     yes  indeed  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one n    of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him  or have made n    him happy if they had  my friend has an excellent understanding--though n    i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr  collins as the n    wisest thing she ever did  she seems perfectly happy  however  and in a n    prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her   n     n     it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a n    distance of her own family and friends   n     n     an easy distance  do you call it  it is nearly fifty miles   n     n     and what is fifty miles of good road  little more than half a day  s n    journey  yes  i call it a  very  easy distance   n     n     i should never have considered the distance as one of the  advantages  n    of the match   cried elizabeth   i should never have said mrs  collins n    was settled  near  her family   n     n     it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire  anything beyond n    the very neighbourhood of longbourn  i suppose  would appear far   n     n    as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she n    understood  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and n    netherfield  and she blushed as she answered  n     n     i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her n    family  the far and the near must be relative  and depend on many n    varying circumstances  where there is fortune to make the expenses of n    travelling unimportant  distance becomes no evil  but that is not the n    case  here   mr  and mrs  collins have a comfortable income  but not n    such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my n    friend would not call herself  near  her family under less than  half  n    the present distance   n     n    mr  darcy drew his chair a little towards her  and said    you  cannot n    have a right to such very strong local attachment   you  cannot have n    been always at longbourn   n     n    elizabeth looked surprised  the gentleman experienced some change of n    feeling  he drew back his chair  took a newspaper from the table  and n    glancing over it  said  in a colder voice  n     n     are you pleased with kent   n     n    a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued  on either side n    calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte n    and her sister  just returned from her walk  the tete-a-tete surprised n    them  mr  darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding n    on miss bennet  and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying n    much to anybody  went away  n     n     what can be the meaning of this   said charlotte  as soon as he was n    gone   my dear  eliza  he must be in love with you  or he would never n    have called us in this familiar way   n     n    but when elizabeth told of his silence  it did not seem very likely  n    even to charlotte s wishes  to be the case  and after various n    conjectures  they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from n    the difficulty of finding anything to do  which was the more probable n    from the time of year  all field sports were over  within doors there n    was lady catherine  books  and a billiard-table  but gentlemen cannot n    always be within doors  and in the nearness of the parsonage  or the n    pleasantness of the walk to it  or of the people who lived in it  the n    two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither n    almost every day  they called at various times of the morning  sometimes n    separately  sometimes together  and now and then accompanied by their n    aunt  it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he n    had pleasure in their society  a persuasion which of course recommended n    him still more  and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in n    being with him  as well as by his evident admiration of her  of her n    former favourite george wickham  and though  in comparing them  she saw n    there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners  n    she believed he might have the best informed mind  n     n    but why mr  darcy came so often to the parsonage  it was more difficult n    to understand  it could not be for society  as he frequently sat there n    ten minutes together without opening his lips  and when he did speak  n    it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice n    to propriety  not a pleasure to himself  he seldom appeared really n    animated  mrs  collins knew not what to make of him  colonel n    fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity  proved that he was n    generally different  which her own knowledge of him could not have told n    her  and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect n    of love  and the object of that love her friend eliza  she set herself n    seriously to work to find it out  she watched him whenever they were at n    rosings  and whenever he came to hunsford  but without much success  he n    certainly looked at her friend a great deal  but the expression of that n    look was disputable  it was an earnest  steadfast gaze  but she often n    doubted whether there were much admiration in it  and sometimes it n    seemed nothing but absence of mind  n     n    she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his n    being partial to her  but elizabeth always laughed at the idea  and mrs  n    collins did not think it right to press the subject  from the danger of n    raising expectations which might only end in disappointment  for in her n    opinion it admitted not of a doubt  that all her friend s dislike would n    vanish  if she could suppose him to be in her power  n     n     n    in her kind schemes for elizabeth  she sometimes planned her marrying n    colonel fitzwilliam  he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man  he n    certainly admired her  and his situation in life was most eligible  but  n    to counterbalance these advantages  mr  darcy had considerable patronage n    in the church  and his cousin could have none at all  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    more than once did elizabeth  in her ramble within the park  n    unexpectedly meet mr  darcy  she felt all the perverseness of the n    mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought  and  to n    prevent its ever happening again  took care to inform him at first that n    it was a favourite haunt of hers  how it could occur a second time  n    therefore  was very odd  yet it did  and even a third  it seemed like n    wilful ill-nature  or a voluntary penance  for on these occasions it was n    not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away  n    but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her  he n    never said a great deal  nor did she give herself the trouble of talking n    or of listening much  but it struck her in the course of their third n    rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about n    her pleasure in being at hunsford  her love of solitary walks  and her n    opinion of mr  and mrs  collins s happiness  and that in speaking of n    rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house  he seemed to n    expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying n     there  too  his words seemed to imply it  could he have colonel n    fitzwilliam in his thoughts  she supposed  if he meant anything  he must n    mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter  it distressed n    her a little  and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the n    pales opposite the parsonage  n     n    she was engaged one day as she walked  in perusing jane s last letter  n    and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in n    spirits  when  instead of being again surprised by mr  darcy  she saw n    on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her  putting away the n    letter immediately and forcing a smile  she said  n     n     i did not know before that you ever walked this way   n     n     i have been making the tour of the park   he replied   as i generally n    do every year  and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage  are n    you going much farther   n     n     no  i should have turned in a moment   n     n    and accordingly she did turn  and they walked towards the parsonage n    together  n     n     do you certainly leave kent on saturday   said she  n     n     yes--if darcy does not put it off again  but i am at his disposal  he n    arranges the business just as he pleases   n     n     and if not able to please himself in the arrangement  he has at least n    pleasure in the great power of choice  i do not know anybody who seems n    more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr  darcy   n     n     he likes to have his own way very well   replied colonel fitzwilliam  n     but so we all do  it is only that he has better means of having it n    than many others  because he is rich  and many others are poor  i speak n    feelingly  a younger son  you know  must be inured to self-denial and n    dependence   n     n     in my opinion  the younger son of an earl can know very little of n    either  now seriously  what have you ever known of self-denial and n    dependence  when have you been prevented by want of money from going n    wherever you chose  or procuring anything you had a fancy for   n     n     these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have n    experienced many hardships of that nature  but in matters of greater n    weight  i may suffer from want of money  younger sons cannot marry where n    they like   n     n     unless where they like women of fortune  which i think they very often n    do   n     n     our habits of expense make us too dependent  and there are not many n    in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to n    money   n     n     is this   thought elizabeth   meant for me   and she coloured at the n    idea  but  recovering herself  said in a lively tone   and pray  what n    is the usual price of an earl s younger son  unless the elder brother is n    very sickly  i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds   n     n    he answered her in the same style  and the subject dropped  to interrupt n    a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed  n    she soon afterwards said  n     n     i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of n    having someone at his disposal  i wonder he does not marry  to secure a n    lasting convenience of that kind  but  perhaps  his sister does as well n    for the present  and  as she is under his sole care  he may do what he n    likes with her   n     n     no   said colonel fitzwilliam   that is an advantage which he must n    divide with me  i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy   n     n     are you indeed  and pray what sort of guardians do you make  does your n    charge give you much trouble  young ladies of her age are sometimes a n    little difficult to manage  and if she has the true darcy spirit  she n    may like to have her own way   n     n    as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly  and the manner n    in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to n    give them any uneasiness  convinced her that she had somehow or other n    got pretty near the truth  she directly replied  n     n     you need not be frightened  i never heard any harm of her  and i dare n    say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world  she is a n    very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance  mrs  hurst and n    miss bingley  i think i have heard you say that you know them   n     n     i know them a little  their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he n    is a great friend of darcy  s   n     n     oh  yes   said elizabeth drily   mr  darcy is uncommonly kind to mr  n    bingley  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him   n     n     care of him  yes  i really believe darcy  does  take care of him in n    those points where he most wants care  from something that he told me in n    our journey hither  i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to n    him  but i ought to beg his pardon  for i have no right to suppose that n    bingley was the person meant  it was all conjecture   n     n     what is it you mean   n     n     it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known  n    because if it were to get round to the lady s family  it would be an n    unpleasant thing   n     n     you may depend upon my not mentioning it   n     n     and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be n    bingley  what he told me was merely this  that he congratulated himself n    on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most n    imprudent marriage  but without mentioning names or any other n    particulars  and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing n    him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort  and from n    knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer   n     n     did mr  darcy give you reasons for this interference   n     n     i understood that there were some very strong objections against the n    lady   n     n     and what arts did he use to separate them   n     n     he did not talk to me of his own arts   said fitzwilliam  smiling   he n    only told me what i have now told you   n     n    elizabeth made no answer  and walked on  her heart swelling with n    indignation  after watching her a little  fitzwilliam asked her why she n    was so thoughtful  n     n     i am thinking of what you have been telling me   said she   your n    cousin  s conduct does not suit my feelings  why was he to be the judge   n     n     you are rather disposed to call his interference officious   n     n     i do not see what right mr  darcy had to decide on the propriety of his n    friend s inclination  or why  upon his own judgement alone  he was to n    determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy  n    but   she continued  recollecting herself   as we know none of the n    particulars  it is not fair to condemn him  it is not to be supposed n    that there was much affection in the case   n     n     that is not an unnatural surmise   said fitzwilliam   but it is a n    lessening of the honour of my cousin  s triumph very sadly   n     n    this was spoken jestingly  but it appeared to her so just a picture n    of mr  darcy  that she would not trust herself with an answer  and n    therefore  abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent n    matters until they reached the parsonage  there  shut into her own room  n    as soon as their visitor left them  she could think without interruption n    of all that she had heard  it was not to be supposed that any other n    people could be meant than those with whom she was connected  there n    could not exist in the world  two  men over whom mr  darcy could have n    such boundless influence  that he had been concerned in the measures n    taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted  but she had n    always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement n    of them  if his own vanity  however  did not mislead him   he  was n    the cause  his pride and caprice were the cause  of all that jane had n    suffered  and still continued to suffer  he had ruined for a while n    every hope of happiness for the most affectionate  generous heart in the n    world  and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted  n     n     there were some very strong objections against the lady   were colonel n    fitzwilliam s words  and those strong objections probably were  her n    having one uncle who was a country attorney  and another who was in n    business in london  n     n     to jane herself   she exclaimed   there could be no possibility of n    objection  all loveliness and goodness as she is --her understanding n    excellent  her mind improved  and her manners captivating  neither n    could anything be urged against my father  who  though with some n    peculiarities  has abilities mr  darcy himself need not disdain  and n    respectability which he will probably never reach   when she thought of n    her mother  her confidence gave way a little  but she would not allow n    that any objections  there  had material weight with mr  darcy  whose n    pride  she was convinced  would receive a deeper wound from the want of n    importance in his friend s connections  than from their want of sense  n    and she was quite decided  at last  that he had been partly governed n    by this worst kind of pride  and partly by the wish of retaining mr  n    bingley for his sister  n     n    the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned  brought on a n    headache  and it grew so much worse towards the evening  that  added to n    her unwillingness to see mr  darcy  it determined her not to attend her n    cousins to rosings  where they were engaged to drink tea  mrs  collins  n    seeing that she was really unwell  did not press her to go and as much n    as possible prevented her husband from pressing her  but mr  collins n    could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather n    displeased by her staying at home  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    when they were gone  elizabeth  as if intending to exasperate herself n    as much as possible against mr  darcy  chose for her employment the n    examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her n    being in kent  they contained no actual complaint  nor was there any n    revival of past occurrences  or any communication of present suffering  n    but in all  and in almost every line of each  there was a want of that n    cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style  and which  n    proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly n    disposed towards everyone  had been scarcely ever clouded  elizabeth n    noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness  with an n    attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal  mr  darcy s n    shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict  gave her n    a keener sense of her sister s sufferings  it was some consolation n    to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the n    next--and  a still greater  that in less than a fortnight she should n    herself be with jane again  and enabled to contribute to the recovery of n    her spirits  by all that affection could do  n     n    she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that n    his cousin was to go with him  but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear n    that he had no intentions at all  and agreeable as he was  she did not n    mean to be unhappy about him  n     n    while settling this point  she was suddenly roused by the sound of the n    door-bell  and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its n    being colonel fitzwilliam himself  who had once before called late in n    the evening  and might now come to inquire particularly after her  n    but this idea was soon banished  and her spirits were very differently n    affected  when  to her utter amazement  she saw mr  darcy walk into the n    room  in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her n    health  imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better  n    she answered him with cold civility  he sat down for a few moments  and n    then getting up  walked about the room  elizabeth was surprised  but n    said not a word  after a silence of several minutes  he came towards her n    in an agitated manner  and thus began  n     n     in vain i have struggled  it will not do  my feelings will not be n    repressed  you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love n    you   n     n    elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression  she stared  coloured  n    doubted  and was silent  this he considered sufficient encouragement  n    and the avowal of all that he felt  and had long felt for her  n    immediately followed  he spoke well  but there were feelings besides n    those of the heart to be detailed  and he was not more eloquent on the n    subject of tenderness than of pride  his sense of her inferiority--of n    its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always n    opposed to inclination  were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to n    the consequence he was wounding  but was very unlikely to recommend his n    suit  n     n    in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike  she could not be insensible to n    the compliment of such a man s affection  and though her intentions did n    not vary for an instant  she was at first sorry for the pain he was to n    receive  till  roused to resentment by his subsequent language  she n    lost all compassion in anger  she tried  however  to compose herself to n    answer him with patience  when he should have done  he concluded with n    representing to her the strength of that attachment which  in spite n    of all his endeavours  he had found impossible to conquer  and with n    expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of n    his hand  as he said this  she could easily see that he had no doubt n    of a favourable answer  he  spoke  of apprehension and anxiety  but n    his countenance expressed real security  such a circumstance could n    only exasperate farther  and  when he ceased  the colour rose into her n    cheeks  and she said  n     n     in such cases as this  it is  i believe  the established mode to n    express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed  however n    unequally they may be returned  it is natural that obligation should n    be felt  and if i could  feel  gratitude  i would now thank you  but i n    cannot--i have never desired your good opinion  and you have certainly n    bestowed it most unwillingly  i am sorry to have occasioned pain to n    anyone  it has been most unconsciously done  however  and i hope will be n    of short duration  the feelings which  you tell me  have long prevented n    the acknowledgment of your regard  can have little difficulty in n    overcoming it after this explanation   n     n    mr  darcy  who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed n    on her face  seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than n    surprise  his complexion became pale with anger  and the disturbance n    of his mind was visible in every feature  he was struggling for the n    appearance of composure  and would not open his lips till he believed n    himself to have attained it  the pause was to elizabeth s feelings n    dreadful  at length  with a voice of forced calmness  he said  n     n     and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting  n    i might  perhaps  wish to be informed why  with so little  endeavour  at n    civility  i am thus rejected  but it is of small importance   n     n     i might as well inquire   replied she   why with so evident a desire n    of offending and insulting me  you chose to tell me that you liked me n    against your will  against your reason  and even against your character  n    was not this some excuse for incivility  if i  was  uncivil  but i have n    other provocations  you know i have  had not my feelings decided against n    you--had they been indifferent  or had they even been favourable  do you n    think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has n    been the means of ruining  perhaps for ever  the happiness of a most n    beloved sister   n     n    as she pronounced these words  mr  darcy changed colour  but the emotion n    was short  and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she n    continued  n     n     i have every reason in the world to think ill of you  no motive can n    excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted  there   you dare not  n    you cannot deny  that you have been the principal  if not the only means n    of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the n    world for caprice and instability  and the other to its derision for n    disappointed hopes  and involving them both in misery of the acutest n    kind   n     n    she paused  and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening n    with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse  n    he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity  n     n     can you deny that you have done it   she repeated  n     n    with assumed tranquillity he then replied   i have no wish of denying n    that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your n    sister  or that i rejoice in my success  towards  him  i have been n    kinder than towards myself   n     n    elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection  n    but its meaning did not escape  nor was it likely to conciliate her  n     n     but it is not merely this affair   she continued   on which my dislike n    is founded  long before it had taken place my opinion of you was n    decided  your character was unfolded in the recital which i received n    many months ago from mr  wickham  on this subject  what can you have to n    say  in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself  n    or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others   n     n     you take an eager interest in that gentleman  s concerns   said darcy  n    in a less tranquil tone  and with a heightened colour  n     n     who that knows what his misfortunes have been  can help feeling an n    interest in him   n     n     his misfortunes   repeated darcy contemptuously   yes  his misfortunes n    have been great indeed   n     n     and of your infliction   cried elizabeth with energy   you have reduced n    him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty  you have n    withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for n    him  you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence n    which was no less his due than his desert  you have done all this  n    and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and n    ridicule   n     n     and this   cried darcy  as he walked with quick steps across the room  n     is your opinion of me  this is the estimation in which you hold me  n    i thank you for explaining it so fully  my faults  according to this n    calculation  are heavy indeed  but perhaps   added he  stopping in n    his walk  and turning towards her   these offenses might have been n    overlooked  had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the n    scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design  these n    bitter accusations might have been suppressed  had i  with greater n    policy  concealed my struggles  and flattered you into the belief of n    my being impelled by unqualified  unalloyed inclination  by reason  by n    reflection  by everything  but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence  n    nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related  they were natural and n    just  could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your n    connections --to congratulate myself on the hope of relations  whose n    condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own   n     n    elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment  yet she tried to n    the utmost to speak with composure when she said  n     n     you are mistaken  mr  darcy  if you suppose that the mode of your n    declaration affected me in any other way  than as it spared me the concern n    which i might have felt in refusing you  had you behaved in a more n    gentlemanlike manner   n     n    she saw him start at this  but he said nothing  and she continued  n     n     you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that n    would have tempted me to accept it   n     n    again his astonishment was obvious  and he looked at her with an n    expression of mingled incredulity and mortification  she went on  n     n     from the very beginning--from the first moment  i may almost say--of n    my acquaintance with you  your manners  impressing me with the fullest n    belief of your arrogance  your conceit  and your selfish disdain of n    the feelings of others  were such as to form the groundwork of n    disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a n    dislike  and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the n    last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry   n     n     you have said quite enough  madam  i perfectly comprehend your n    feelings  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been  n    forgive me for having taken up so much of your time  and accept my best n    wishes for your health and happiness   n     n    and with these words he hastily left the room  and elizabeth heard him n    the next moment open the front door and quit the house  n     n    the tumult of her mind  was now painfully great  she knew not how n    to support herself  and from actual weakness sat down and cried for n    half-an-hour  her astonishment  as she reflected on what had passed  n    was increased by every review of it  that she should receive an offer of n    marriage from mr  darcy  that he should have been in love with her for n    so many months  so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of n    all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying n    her sister  and which must appear at least with equal force in his n    own case--was almost incredible  it was gratifying to have inspired n    unconsciously so strong an affection  but his pride  his abominable n    pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to n    jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging  though he could n    not justify it  and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr  n    wickham  his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny  soon n    overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for n    a moment excited  she continued in very agitated reflections till the n    sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to n    encounter charlotte s observation  and hurried her away to her room  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations n    which had at length closed her eyes  she could not yet recover from the n    surprise of what had happened  it was impossible to think of anything n    else  and  totally indisposed for employment  she resolved  soon after n    breakfast  to indulge herself in air and exercise  she was proceeding n    directly to her favourite walk  when the recollection of mr  darcy s n    sometimes coming there stopped her  and instead of entering the park  n    she turned up the lane  which led farther from the turnpike-road  the n    park paling was still the boundary on one side  and she soon passed one n    of the gates into the ground  n     n    after walking two or three times along that part of the lane  she was n    tempted  by the pleasantness of the morning  to stop at the gates and n    look into the park  the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had n    made a great difference in the country  and every day was adding to the n    verdure of the early trees  she was on the point of continuing her walk  n    when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which n    edged the park  he was moving that way  and  fearful of its being mr  n    darcy  she was directly retreating  but the person who advanced was now n    near enough to see her  and stepping forward with eagerness  pronounced n    her name  she had turned away  but on hearing herself called  though n    in a voice which proved it to be mr  darcy  she moved again towards the n    gate  he had by that time reached it also  and  holding out a letter  n    which she instinctively took  said  with a look of haughty composure  n     i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you  n    will you do me the honour of reading that letter   and then  with a n    slight bow  turned again into the plantation  and was soon out of sight  n     n    with no expectation of pleasure  but with the strongest curiosity  n    elizabeth opened the letter  and  to her still increasing wonder  n    perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper  written n    quite through  in a very close hand  the envelope itself was likewise n    full  pursuing her way along the lane  she then began it  it was dated n    from rosings  at eight o clock in the morning  and was as follows -- n     n     be not alarmed  madam  on receiving this letter  by the apprehension n    of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those n    offers which were last night so disgusting to you  i write without any n    intention of paining you  or humbling myself  by dwelling on wishes n    which  for the happiness of both  cannot be too soon forgotten  and the n    effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion  n    should have been spared  had not my character required it to be written n    and read  you must  therefore  pardon the freedom with which i demand n    your attention  your feelings  i know  will bestow it unwillingly  but i n    demand it of your justice  n     n     two offenses of a very different nature  and by no means of equal n    magnitude  you last night laid to my charge  the first mentioned was  n    that  regardless of the sentiments of either  i had detached mr  bingley n    from your sister  and the other  that i had  in defiance of various n    claims  in defiance of honour and humanity  ruined the immediate n    prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr  wickham  wilfully and n    wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth  the acknowledged n    favourite of my father  a young man who had scarcely any other n    dependence than on our patronage  and who had been brought up to expect n    its exertion  would be a depravity  to which the separation of two young n    persons  whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks  could n    bear no comparison  but from the severity of that blame which was last n    night so liberally bestowed  respecting each circumstance  i shall hope n    to be in the future secured  when the following account of my actions n    and their motives has been read  if  in the explanation of them  which n    is due to myself  i am under the necessity of relating feelings which n    may be offensive to yours  i can only say that i am sorry  the necessity n    must be obeyed  and further apology would be absurd  n     n     i had not been long in hertfordshire  before i saw  in common with n    others  that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young n    woman in the country  but it was not till the evening of the dance n    at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious n    attachment  i had often seen him in love before  at that ball  while i n    had the honour of dancing with you  i was first made acquainted  by sir n    william lucas s accidental information  that bingley s attentions to n    your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage  n    he spoke of it as a certain event  of which the time alone could n    be undecided  from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour n    attentively  and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss n    bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him  your sister i also n    watched  her look and manners were open  cheerful  and engaging as ever  n    but without any symptom of peculiar regard  and i remained convinced n    from the evening s scrutiny  that though she received his attentions n    with pleasure  she did not invite them by any participation of n    sentiment  if  you  have not been mistaken here   i  must have been n    in error  your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter n    probable  if it be so  if i have been misled by such error to inflict n    pain on her  your resentment has not been unreasonable  but i shall not n    scruple to assert  that the serenity of your sister s countenance and n    air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction n    that  however amiable her temper  her heart was not likely to be n    easily touched  that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is n    certain--but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions n    are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears  i did not believe n    her to be indifferent because i wished it  i believed it on impartial n    conviction  as truly as i wished it in reason  my objections to the n    marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have n    the utmost force of passion to put aside  in my own case  the want of n    connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me  but n    there were other causes of repugnance  causes which  though still n    existing  and existing to an equal degree in both instances  i had n    myself endeavoured to forget  because they were not immediately before n    me  these causes must be stated  though briefly  the situation of your n    mother s family  though objectionable  was nothing in comparison to that n    total want of propriety so frequently  so almost uniformly betrayed by n    herself  by your three younger sisters  and occasionally even by your n    father  pardon me  it pains me to offend you  but amidst your concern n    for the defects of your nearest relations  and your displeasure at this n    representation of them  let it give you consolation to consider that  to n    have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure  n    is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister  than n    it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both  i will only say n    farther that from what passed that evening  my opinion of all parties n    was confirmed  and every inducement heightened which could have led n    me before  to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy n    connection  he left netherfield for london  on the day following  as n    you  i am certain  remember  with the design of soon returning  n     n     the part which i acted is now to be explained  his sisters   uneasiness n    had been equally excited with my own  our coincidence of feeling was n    soon discovered  and  alike sensible that no time was to be lost in n    detaching their brother  we shortly resolved on joining him directly in n    london  we accordingly went--and there i readily engaged in the office n    of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice  i n    described  and enforced them earnestly  but  however this remonstrance n    might have staggered or delayed his determination  i do not suppose n    that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage  had it not been n    seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving  of your n    sister s indifference  he had before believed her to return his n    affection with sincere  if not with equal regard  but bingley has great n    natural modesty  with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his n    own  to convince him  therefore  that he had deceived himself  was n    no very difficult point  to persuade him against returning into n    hertfordshire  when that conviction had been given  was scarcely the n    work of a moment  i cannot blame myself for having done thus much  there n    is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not n    reflect with satisfaction  it is that i condescended to adopt the n    measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in n    town  i knew it myself  as it was known to miss bingley  but her n    brother is even yet ignorant of it  that they might have met without n    ill consequence is perhaps probable  but his regard did not appear to me n    enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger  perhaps this n    concealment  this disguise was beneath me  it is done  however  and it n    was done for the best  on this subject i have nothing more to say  no n    other apology to offer  if i have wounded your sister s feelings  it n    was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to n    you very naturally appear insufficient  i have not yet learnt to condemn n    them  n     n     with respect to that other  more weighty accusation  of having injured n    mr  wickham  i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his n    connection with my family  of what he has  particularly  accused me i n    am ignorant  but of the truth of what i shall relate  i can summon more n    than one witness of undoubted veracity  n     n     mr  wickham is the son of a very respectable man  who had for many n    years the management of all the pemberley estates  and whose good n    conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to n    be of service to him  and on george wickham  who was his godson  his n    kindness was therefore liberally bestowed  my father supported him at n    school  and afterwards at cambridge--most important assistance  as his n    own father  always poor from the extravagance of his wife  would have n    been unable to give him a gentleman s education  my father was not only n    fond of this young man s society  whose manners were always engaging  he n    had also the highest opinion of him  and hoping the church would be n    his profession  intended to provide for him in it  as for myself  it is n    many  many years since i first began to think of him in a very different n    manner  the vicious propensities--the want of principle  which he was n    careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend  could not escape n    the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself  n    and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments  which mr  n    darcy could not have  here again i shall give you pain--to what degree n    you only can tell  but whatever may be the sentiments which mr  wickham n    has created  a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from n    unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive  n     n     my excellent father died about five years ago  and his attachment to n    mr  wickham was to the last so steady  that in his will he particularly n    recommended it to me  to promote his advancement in the best manner n    that his profession might allow--and if he took orders  desired that a n    valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant  there n    was also a legacy of one thousand pounds  his own father did not long n    survive mine  and within half a year from these events  mr  wickham n    wrote to inform me that  having finally resolved against taking orders  n    he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more n    immediate pecuniary advantage  in lieu of the preferment  by which he n    could not be benefited  he had some intention  he added  of studying n    law  and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would n    be a very insufficient support therein  i rather wished  than believed n    him to be sincere  but  at any rate  was perfectly ready to accede to n    his proposal  i knew that mr  wickham ought not to be a clergyman  the n    business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance n    in the church  were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to n    receive it  and accepted in return three thousand pounds  all connection n    between us seemed now dissolved  i thought too ill of him to invite him n    to pemberley  or admit his society in town  in town i believe he chiefly n    lived  but his studying the law was a mere pretence  and being now free n    from all restraint  his life was a life of idleness and dissipation  n    for about three years i heard little of him  but on the decease of the n    incumbent of the living which had been designed for him  he applied to n    me again by letter for the presentation  his circumstances  he assured n    me  and i had no difficulty in believing it  were exceedingly bad  he n    had found the law a most unprofitable study  and was now absolutely n    resolved on being ordained  if i would present him to the living in n    question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt  as he was n    well assured that i had no other person to provide for  and i could not n    have forgotten my revered father s intentions  you will hardly blame n    me for refusing to comply with this entreaty  or for resisting every n    repetition to it  his resentment was in proportion to the distress of n    his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me n    to others as in his reproaches to myself  after this period every n    appearance of acquaintance was dropped  how he lived i know not  but n    last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice  n     n     i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself  n    and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold n    to any human being  having said thus much  i feel no doubt of your n    secrecy  my sister  who is more than ten years my junior  was left to n    the guardianship of my mother s nephew  colonel fitzwilliam  and myself  n    about a year ago  she was taken from school  and an establishment formed n    for her in london  and last summer she went with the lady who presided n    over it  to ramsgate  and thither also went mr  wickham  undoubtedly by n    design  for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him n    and mrs  younge  in whose character we were most unhappily deceived  and n    by her connivance and aid  he so far recommended himself to georgiana  n    whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to n    her as a child  that she was persuaded to believe herself in love  and n    to consent to an elopement  she was then but fifteen  which must be her n    excuse  and after stating her imprudence  i am happy to add  that i owed n    the knowledge of it to herself  i joined them unexpectedly a day or two n    before the intended elopement  and then georgiana  unable to support the n    idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as n    a father  acknowledged the whole to me  you may imagine what i felt and n    how i acted  regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented n    any public exposure  but i wrote to mr  wickham  who left the place n    immediately  and mrs  younge was of course removed from her charge  mr  n    wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune  which n    is thirty thousand pounds  but i cannot help supposing that the hope of n    revenging himself on me was a strong inducement  his revenge would have n    been complete indeed  n     n     this  madam  is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have n    been concerned together  and if you do not absolutely reject it as n    false  you will  i hope  acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr  n    wickham  i know not in what manner  under what form of falsehood he n    had imposed on you  but his success is not perhaps to be wondered n    at  ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either  n    detection could not be in your power  and suspicion certainly not in n    your inclination  n     n     you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night  but n    i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to n    be revealed  for the truth of everything here related  i can appeal more n    particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam  who  from our n    near relationship and constant intimacy  and  still more  as one of n    the executors of my father s will  has been unavoidably acquainted n    with every particular of these transactions  if your abhorrence of  me  n    should make  my  assertions valueless  you cannot be prevented by n    the same cause from confiding in my cousin  and that there may be n    the possibility of consulting him  i shall endeavour to find some n    opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the n    morning  i will only add  god bless you  n     n     fitzwilliam darcy  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    if elizabeth  when mr  darcy gave her the letter  did not expect it to n    contain a renewal of his offers  she had formed no expectation at all of n    its contents  but such as they were  it may well be supposed how eagerly n    she went through them  and what a contrariety of emotion they excited  n    her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined  with amazement did n    she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power  n    and steadfastly was she persuaded  that he could have no explanation n    to give  which a just sense of shame would not conceal  with a strong n    prejudice against everything he might say  she began his account of what n    had happened at netherfield  she read with an eagerness which hardly n    left her power of comprehension  and from impatience of knowing what the n    next sentence might bring  was incapable of attending to the sense of n    the one before her eyes  his belief of her sister s insensibility she n    instantly resolved to be false  and his account of the real  the worst n    objections to the match  made her too angry to have any wish of doing n    him justice  he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied n    her  his style was not penitent  but haughty  it was all pride and n    insolence  n     n    but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr  wickham--when n    she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which  n    if true  must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth  and which n    bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her n    feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition  n    astonishment  apprehension  and even horror  oppressed her  she wished n    to discredit it entirely  repeatedly exclaiming   this must be false  n    this cannot be  this must be the grossest falsehood  --and when she had n    gone through the whole letter  though scarcely knowing anything of the n    last page or two  put it hastily away  protesting that she would not n    regard it  that she would never look in it again  n     n    in this perturbed state of mind  with thoughts that could rest on n    nothing  she walked on  but it would not do  in half a minute the letter n    was unfolded again  and collecting herself as well as she could  she n    again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham  and n    commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence  n    the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what n    he had related himself  and the kindness of the late mr  darcy  though n    she had not before known its extent  agreed equally well with his own n    words  so far each recital confirmed the other  but when she came to the n    will  the difference was great  what wickham had said of the living n    was fresh in her memory  and as she recalled his very words  it was n    impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the n    other  and  for a few moments  she flattered herself that her wishes did n    not err  but when she read and re-read with the closest attention  the n    particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions n    to the living  of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three n    thousand pounds  again was she forced to hesitate  she put down n    the letter  weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be n    impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with n    little success  on both sides it was only assertion  again she read n    on  but every line proved more clearly that the affair  which she had n    believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to n    render mr  darcy s conduct in it less than infamous  was capable of a n    turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole  n     n    the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at n    mr  wickham s charge  exceedingly shocked her  the more so  as she could n    bring no proof of its injustice  she had never heard of him before his n    entrance into the ----shire militia  in which he had engaged at the n    persuasion of the young man who  on meeting him accidentally in town  n    had there renewed a slight acquaintance  of his former way of life n    nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself  as n    to his real character  had information been in her power  she had n    never felt a wish of inquiring  his countenance  voice  and manner had n    established him at once in the possession of every virtue  she tried n    to recollect some instance of goodness  some distinguished trait of n    integrity or benevolence  that might rescue him from the attacks of n    mr  darcy  or at least  by the predominance of virtue  atone for those n    casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr  darcy n    had described as the idleness and vice of many years  continuance  but n    no such recollection befriended her  she could see him instantly before n    her  in every charm of air and address  but she could remember no more n    substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood  and n    the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess  after n    pausing on this point a considerable while  she once more continued to n    read  but  alas  the story which followed  of his designs on miss n    darcy  received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel n    fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before  and at last she was n    referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam n    himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his n    near concern in all his cousin s affairs  and whose character she had no n    reason to question  at one time she had almost resolved on applying to n    him  but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application  and n    at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr  darcy would never n    have hazarded such a proposal  if he had not been well assured of his n    cousin s corroboration  n     n    she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation n    between wickham and herself  in their first evening at mr  phillips s  n    many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory  she was  now  n    struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger  and n    wondered it had escaped her before  she saw the indelicacy of putting n    himself forward as he had done  and the inconsistency of his professions n    with his conduct  she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear n    of seeing mr  darcy--that mr  darcy might leave the country  but that n     he  should stand his ground  yet he had avoided the netherfield ball n    the very next week  she remembered also that  till the netherfield n    family had quitted the country  he had told his story to no one but n    herself  but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed  n    that he had then no reserves  no scruples in sinking mr  darcy s n    character  though he had assured her that respect for the father would n    always prevent his exposing the son  n     n    how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned  n    his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and n    hatefully mercenary  and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer n    the moderation of his wishes  but his eagerness to grasp at anything  n    his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive  he had n    either been deceived with regard to her fortune  or had been gratifying n    his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most n    incautiously shown  every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter n    and fainter  and in farther justification of mr  darcy  she could not n    but allow that mr  bingley  when questioned by jane  had long ago n    asserted his blamelessness in the affair  that proud and repulsive as n    were his manners  she had never  in the whole course of their n    acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much n    together  and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything n    that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him n    of irreligious or immoral habits  that among his own connections he was n    esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a n    brother  and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his n    sister as to prove him capable of  some  amiable feeling  that had his n    actions been what mr  wickham represented them  so gross a violation of n    everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world  and n    that friendship between a person capable of it  and such an amiable man n    as mr  bingley  was incomprehensible  n     n    she grew absolutely ashamed of herself  of neither darcy nor wickham n    could she think without feeling she had been blind  partial  prejudiced  n    absurd  n     n     how despicably i have acted   she cried   i  who have prided myself n    on my discernment  i  who have valued myself on my abilities  who have n    often disdained the generous candour of my sister  and gratified n    my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust  how humiliating is this n    discovery  yet  how just a humiliation  had i been in love  i could n    not have been more wretchedly blind  but vanity  not love  has been my n    folly  pleased with the preference of one  and offended by the neglect n    of the other  on the very beginning of our acquaintance  i have courted n    prepossession and ignorance  and driven reason away  where either were n    concerned  till this moment i never knew myself   n     n    from herself to jane--from jane to bingley  her thoughts were in a line n    which soon brought to her recollection that mr  darcy s explanation n     there  had appeared very insufficient  and she read it again  widely n    different was the effect of a second perusal  how could she deny that n    credit to his assertions in one instance  which she had been obliged to n    give in the other  he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her n    sister s attachment  and she could not help remembering what charlotte s n    opinion had always been  neither could she deny the justice of his n    description of jane  she felt that jane s feelings  though fervent  were n    little displayed  and that there was a constant complacency in her air n    and manner not often united with great sensibility  n     n    when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were n    mentioned in terms of such mortifying  yet merited reproach  her sense n    of shame was severe  the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly n    for denial  and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as n    having passed at the netherfield ball  and as confirming all his first n    disapprobation  could not have made a stronger impression on his mind n    than on hers  n     n    the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt  it soothed  n    but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been n    self-attracted by the rest of her family  and as she considered n    that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest n    relations  and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt n    by such impropriety of conduct  she felt depressed beyond anything she n    had ever known before  n     n    after wandering along the lane for two hours  giving way to every n    variety of thought--re-considering events  determining probabilities  n    and reconciling herself  as well as she could  to a change so sudden and n    so important  fatigue  and a recollection of her long absence  made n    her at length return home  and she entered the house with the wish n    of appearing cheerful as usual  and the resolution of repressing such n    reflections as must make her unfit for conversation  n     n    she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each n    called during her absence  mr  darcy  only for a few minutes  to take n    leave--but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least n    an hour  hoping for her return  and almost resolving to walk after her n    till she could be found  elizabeth could but just  affect  concern n    in missing him  she really rejoiced at it  colonel fitzwilliam was no n    longer an object  she could think only of her letter  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning  and mr  collins having n    been in waiting near the lodges  to make them his parting obeisance  was n    able to bring home the pleasing intelligence  of their appearing in very n    good health  and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected  after the n    melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings  to rosings he then n    hastened  to console lady catherine and her daughter  and on his return n    brought back  with great satisfaction  a message from her ladyship  n    importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of n    having them all to dine with her  n     n    elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that  had n    she chosen it  she might by this time have been presented to her as n    her future niece  nor could she think  without a smile  of what her n    ladyship  s indignation would have been   what would she have said  how n    would she have behaved   were questions with which she amused herself  n     n    their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party   i assure n    you  i feel it exceedingly   said lady catherine   i believe no one n    feels the loss of friends so much as i do  but i am particularly n    attached to these young men  and know them to be so much attached to n    me  they were excessively sorry to go  but so they always are  the n    dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last  but darcy n    seemed to feel it most acutely  more  i think  than last year  his n    attachment to rosings certainly increases   n     n    mr  collins had a compliment  and an allusion to throw in here  which n    were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter  n     n    lady catherine observed  after dinner  that miss bennet seemed out of n    spirits  and immediately accounting for it by herself  by supposing that n    she did not like to go home again so soon  she added  n     n     but if that is the case  you must write to your mother and beg that n    you may stay a little longer  mrs  collins will be very glad of your n    company  i am sure   n     n     i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation   replied n    elizabeth   but it is not in my power to accept it  i must be in town n    next saturday   n     n     why  at that rate  you will have been here only six weeks  i expected n    you to stay two months  i told mrs  collins so before you came  there n    can be no occasion for your going so soon  mrs  bennet could certainly n    spare you for another fortnight   n     n     but my father cannot  he wrote last week to hurry my return   n     n     oh  your father of course may spare you  if your mother can  daughters n    are never of so much consequence to a father  and if you will stay n    another  month  complete  it will be in my power to take one of you as n    far as london  for i am going there early in june  for a week  and as n    dawson does not object to the barouche-box  there will be very good room n    for one of you--and indeed  if the weather should happen to be cool  i n    should not object to taking you both  as you are neither of you large   n     n     you are all kindness  madam  but i believe we must abide by our n    original plan   n     n    lady catherine seemed resigned   mrs  collins  you must send a servant n    with them  you know i always speak my mind  and i cannot bear the idea n    of two young women travelling post by themselves  it is highly improper  n    you must contrive to send somebody  i have the greatest dislike in n    the world to that sort of thing  young women should always be properly n    guarded and attended  according to their situation in life  when my n    niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer  i made a point of her n    having two men-servants go with her  miss darcy  the daughter of n    mr  darcy  of pemberley  and lady anne  could not have appeared with n    propriety in a different manner  i am excessively attentive to all those n    things  you must send john with the young ladies  mrs  collins  i n    am glad it occurred to me to mention it  for it would really be n    discreditable to  you  to let them go alone   n     n     my uncle is to send a servant for us   n     n     oh  your uncle  he keeps a man-servant  does he  i am very glad you n    have somebody who thinks of these things  where shall you change horses  n    oh  bromley  of course  if you mention my name at the bell  you will be n    attended to   n     n    lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey  n    and as she did not answer them all herself  attention was necessary  n    which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her  or  with a mind so n    occupied  she might have forgotten where she was  reflection must be n    reserved for solitary hours  whenever she was alone  she gave way to it n    as the greatest relief  and not a day went by without a solitary n    walk  in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant n    recollections  n     n    mr  darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart  she n    studied every sentence  and her feelings towards its writer were at n    times widely different  when she remembered the style of his address  n    she was still full of indignation  but when she considered how unjustly n    she had condemned and upbraided him  her anger was turned against n    herself  and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion  n    his attachment excited gratitude  his general character respect  but she n    could not approve him  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal  n    or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again  in her own past n    behaviour  there was a constant source of vexation and regret  and in n    the unhappy defects of her family  a subject of yet heavier chagrin  n    they were hopeless of remedy  her father  contented with laughing at n    them  would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his n    youngest daughters  and her mother  with manners so far from right n    herself  was entirely insensible of the evil  elizabeth had frequently n    united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine n    and lydia  but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence  n    what chance could there be of improvement  catherine  weak-spirited  n    irritable  and completely under lydia s guidance  had been always n    affronted by their advice  and lydia  self-willed and careless  would n    scarcely give them a hearing  they were ignorant  idle  and vain  while n    there was an officer in meryton  they would flirt with him  and while n    meryton was within a walk of longbourn  they would be going there n    forever  n     n    anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern  and mr  darcy s n    explanation  by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion  n    heightened the sense of what jane had lost  his affection was proved n    to have been sincere  and his conduct cleared of all blame  unless any n    could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend  how n    grievous then was the thought that  of a situation so desirable in every n    respect  so replete with advantage  so promising for happiness  jane had n    been deprived  by the folly and indecorum of her own family  n     n    when to these recollections was added the development of wickham s n    character  it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had n    seldom been depressed before  were now so much affected as to make it n    almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful  n     n    their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of n    her stay as they had been at first  the very last evening was spent n    there  and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of n    their journey  gave them directions as to the best method of packing  n    and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right n    way  that maria thought herself obliged  on her return  to undo all the n    work of the morning  and pack her trunk afresh  n     n    when they parted  lady catherine  with great condescension  wished them n    a good journey  and invited them to come to hunsford again next year  n    and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her n    hand to both  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    on saturday morning elizabeth and mr  collins met for breakfast a few n    minutes before the others appeared  and he took the opportunity of n    paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary  n     n     i know not  miss elizabeth   said he   whether mrs  collins has yet n    expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us  but i am very n    certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for n    it  the favour of your company has been much felt  i assure you  we n    know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode  our plain n    manner of living  our small rooms and few domestics  and the little we n    see of the world  must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like n    yourself  but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension  n    and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending n    your time unpleasantly   n     n    elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness  she n    had spent six weeks with great enjoyment  and the pleasure of being with n    charlotte  and the kind attentions she had received  must make  her  n    feel the obliged  mr  collins was gratified  and with a more smiling n    solemnity replied  n     n     it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not n    disagreeably  we have certainly done our best  and most fortunately n    having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society  and  n    from our connection with rosings  the frequent means of varying the n    humble home scene  i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford n    visit cannot have been entirely irksome  our situation with regard to n    lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage n    and blessing which few can boast  you see on what a footing we are  you n    see how continually we are engaged there  in truth i must acknowledge n    that  with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage  i should n    not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion  while they are n    sharers of our intimacy at rosings   n     n    words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings  and he was n    obliged to walk about the room  while elizabeth tried to unite civility n    and truth in a few short sentences  n     n     you may  in fact  carry a very favourable report of us into n    hertfordshire  my dear cousin  i flatter myself at least that you will n    be able to do so  lady catherine s great attentions to mrs  collins you n    have been a daily witness of  and altogether i trust it does not appear n    that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be n    as well to be silent  only let me assure you  my dear miss elizabeth  n    that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in n    marriage  my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of n    thinking  there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of n    character and ideas between us  we seem to have been designed for each n    other   n     n    elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was n    the case  and with equal sincerity could add  that she firmly believed n    and rejoiced in his domestic comforts  she was not sorry  however  to n    have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang  n    poor charlotte  it was melancholy to leave her to such society  but she n    had chosen it with her eyes open  and though evidently regretting that n    her visitors were to go  she did not seem to ask for compassion  her n    home and her housekeeping  her parish and her poultry  and all their n    dependent concerns  had not yet lost their charms  n     n    at length the chaise arrived  the trunks were fastened on  the parcels n    placed within  and it was pronounced to be ready  after an affectionate n    parting between the friends  elizabeth was attended to the carriage by n    mr  collins  and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her n    with his best respects to all her family  not forgetting his thanks n    for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter  and his n    compliments to mr  and mrs  gardiner  though unknown  he then handed her n    in  maria followed  and the door was on the point of being closed  n    when he suddenly reminded them  with some consternation  that they had n    hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings  n     n     but   he added   you will of course wish to have your humble respects n    delivered to them  with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you n    while you have been here   n     n    elizabeth made no objection  the door was then allowed to be shut  and n    the carriage drove off  n     n     good gracious   cried maria  after a few minutes   silence   it seems n    but a day or two since we first came  and yet how many things have n    happened   n     n     a great many indeed   said her companion with a sigh  n     n     we have dined nine times at rosings  besides drinking tea there twice  n    how much i shall have to tell   n     n    elizabeth added privately   and how much i shall have to conceal   n     n    their journey was performed without much conversation  or any alarm  and n    within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr  gardiner s n    house  where they were to remain a few days  n     n    jane looked well  and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her n    spirits  amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her n    aunt had reserved for them  but jane was to go home with her  and at n    longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation  n     n    it was not without an effort  meanwhile  that she could wait even for n    longbourn  before she told her sister of mr  darcy s proposals  to know n    that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish n    jane  and must  at the same time  so highly gratify whatever of her own n    vanity she had not yet been able to reason away  was such a temptation n    to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision n    in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate  n    and her fear  if she once entered on the subject  of being hurried n    into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister n    further  n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    it was the second week in may  in which the three young ladies set out n    together from gracechurch street for the town of ----  in hertfordshire  n    and  as they drew near the appointed inn where mr  bennet s carriage n    was to meet them  they quickly perceived  in token of the coachman s n    punctuality  both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs  n    these two girls had been above an hour in the place  happily employed n    in visiting an opposite milliner  watching the sentinel on guard  and n    dressing a salad and cucumber  n     n    after welcoming their sisters  they triumphantly displayed a table set n    out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords  exclaiming  n     is not this nice  is not this an agreeable surprise   n     n     and we mean to treat you all   added lydia   but you must lend us the n    money  for we have just spent ours at the shop out there   then  showing n    her purchases-- look here  i have bought this bonnet  i do not think n    it is very pretty  but i thought i might as well buy it as not  i shall n    pull it to pieces as soon as i get home  and see if i can make it up any n    better   n     n    and when her sisters abused it as ugly  she added  with perfect n    unconcern   oh  but there were two or three much uglier in the shop  and n    when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh  i n    think it will be very tolerable  besides  it will not much signify what n    one wears this summer  after the ----shire have left meryton  and they n    are going in a fortnight   n     n     are they indeed   cried elizabeth  with the greatest satisfaction  n     n     they are going to be encamped near brighton  and i do so want papa to n    take us all there for the summer  it would be such a delicious scheme  n    and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all  mamma would like to n    go too of all things  only think what a miserable summer else we shall n    have   n     n     yes   thought elizabeth    that  would be a delightful scheme indeed  n    and completely do for us at once  good heaven  brighton  and a whole n    campful of soldiers  to us  who have been overset already by one poor n    regiment of militia  and the monthly balls of meryton   n     n     now i have got some news for you   said lydia  as they sat down at n    table   what do you think  it is excellent news--capital news--and about n    a certain person we all like   n     n    jane and elizabeth looked at each other  and the waiter was told he need n    not stay  lydia laughed  and said  n     n     aye  that is just like your formality and discretion  you thought the n    waiter must not hear  as if he cared  i dare say he often hears worse n    things said than i am going to say  but he is an ugly fellow  i am glad n    he is gone  i never saw such a long chin in my life  well  but now for n    my news  it is about dear wickham  too good for the waiter  is it not  n    there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king  there s for you  she n    is gone down to her uncle at liverpool  gone to stay  wickham is safe   n     n     and mary king is safe   added elizabeth   safe from a connection n    imprudent as to fortune   n     n     she is a great fool for going away  if she liked him   n     n     but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side   said jane  n     n     i am sure there is not on  his   i will answer for it  he never cared n    three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled n    thing   n     n    elizabeth was shocked to think that  however incapable of such n    coarseness of  expression  herself  the coarseness of the  sentiment  n    was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal  n     n    as soon as all had ate  and the elder ones paid  the carriage was n    ordered  and after some contrivance  the whole party  with all their n    boxes  work-bags  and parcels  and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and n    lydia s purchases  were seated in it  n     n     how nicely we are all crammed in   cried lydia   i am glad i bought my n    bonnet  if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox  well  now n    let us be quite comfortable and snug  and talk and laugh all the way n    home  and in the first place  let us hear what has happened to you all n    since you went away  have you seen any pleasant men  have you had any n    flirting  i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband n    before you came back  jane will be quite an old maid soon  i declare  n    she is almost three-and-twenty  lord  how ashamed i should be of not n    being married before three-and-twenty  my aunt phillips wants you so to n    get husbands  you can t think  she says lizzy had better have taken mr  n    collins  but  i  do not think there would have been any fun in it  lord  n    how i should like to be married before any of you  and then i would n    chaperon you about to all the balls  dear me  we had such a good piece n    of fun the other day at colonel forster s  kitty and me were to spend n    the day there  and mrs  forster promised to have a little dance in the n    evening   by the bye  mrs  forster and me are  such  friends   and so n    she asked the two harringtons to come  but harriet was ill  and so pen n    was forced to come by herself  and then  what do you think we did  we n    dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a n    lady  only think what fun  not a soul knew of it  but colonel and mrs  n    forster  and kitty and me  except my aunt  for we were forced to borrow n    one of her gowns  and you cannot imagine how well he looked  when denny  n    and wickham  and pratt  and two or three more of the men came in  they n    did not know him in the least  lord  how i laughed  and so did mrs  n    forster  i thought i should have died  and  that  made the men suspect n    something  and then they soon found out what was the matter   n     n    with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes  did n    lydia  assisted by kitty s hints and additions  endeavour to amuse her n    companions all the way to longbourn  elizabeth listened as little as she n    could  but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name  n     n    their reception at home was most kind  mrs  bennet rejoiced to see jane n    in undiminished beauty  and more than once during dinner did mr  bennet n    say voluntarily to elizabeth  n     n     i am glad you are come back  lizzy   n     n    their party in the dining-room was large  for almost all the lucases n    came to meet maria and hear the news  and various were the subjects that n    occupied them  lady lucas was inquiring of maria  after the welfare and n    poultry of her eldest daughter  mrs  bennet was doubly engaged  on one n    hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane  who sat n    some way below her  and  on the other  retailing them all to the younger n    lucases  and lydia  in a voice rather louder than any other person s  n    was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who n    would hear her  n     n     oh  mary   said she   i wish you had gone with us  for we had such fun  n    as we went along  kitty and i drew up the blinds  and pretended there n    was nobody in the coach  and i should have gone so all the way  if kitty n    had not been sick  and when we got to the george  i do think we behaved n    very handsomely  for we treated the other three with the nicest cold n    luncheon in the world  and if you would have gone  we would have treated n    you too  and then when we came away it was such fun  i thought we never n    should have got into the coach  i was ready to die of laughter  and then n    we were so merry all the way home  we talked and laughed so loud  that n    anybody might have heard us ten miles off   n     n    to this mary very gravely replied   far be it from me  my dear sister  n    to depreciate such pleasures  they would doubtless be congenial with the n    generality of female minds  but i confess they would have no charms for n     me --i should infinitely prefer a book   n     n    but of this answer lydia heard not a word  she seldom listened to n    anybody for more than half a minute  and never attended to mary at all  n     n    in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk n    to meryton  and to see how everybody went on  but elizabeth steadily n    opposed the scheme  it should not be said that the miss bennets could n    not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers  n    there was another reason too for her opposition  she dreaded seeing mr  n    wickham again  and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible  the n    comfort to  her  of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond n    expression  in a fortnight they were to go--and once gone  she hoped n    there could be nothing more to plague her on his account  n     n    she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton n    scheme  of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn  was under n    frequent discussion between her parents  elizabeth saw directly that her n    father had not the smallest intention of yielding  but his answers were n    at the same time so vague and equivocal  that her mother  though often n    disheartened  had never yet despaired of succeeding at last  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could n    no longer be overcome  and at length  resolving to suppress every n    particular in which her sister was concerned  and preparing her to be n    surprised  she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene n    between mr  darcy and herself  n     n    miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly n    partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly n    natural  and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings  she was n    sorry that mr  darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so n    little suited to recommend them  but still more was she grieved for the n    unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him  n     n     his being so sure of succeeding was wrong   said she   and certainly n    ought not to have appeared  but consider how much it must increase his n    disappointment   n     n     indeed   replied elizabeth   i am heartily sorry for him  but he has n    other feelings  which will probably soon drive away his regard for me  n    you do not blame me  however  for refusing him   n     n     blame you  oh  no   n     n     but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham   n     n     no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did   n     n     but you  will  know it  when i tell you what happened the very next n    day   n     n    she then spoke of the letter  repeating the whole of its contents as far n    as they concerned george wickham  what a stroke was this for poor jane  n    who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that n    so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind  as was here n    collected in one individual  nor was darcy s vindication  though n    grateful to her feelings  capable of consoling her for such discovery  n    most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error  and n    seek to clear the one without involving the other  n     n     this will not do   said elizabeth   you never will be able to make both n    of them good for anything  take your choice  but you must be satisfied n    with only one  there is but such a quantity of merit between them  just n    enough to make one good sort of man  and of late it has been shifting n    about pretty much  for my part  i am inclined to believe it all darcy s  n    but you shall do as you choose   n     n    it was some time  however  before a smile could be extorted from jane  n     n     i do not know when i have been more shocked   said she   wickham so n    very bad  it is almost past belief  and poor mr  darcy  dear lizzy  only n    consider what he must have suffered  such a disappointment  and with the n    knowledge of your ill opinion  too  and having to relate such a thing n    of his sister  it is really too distressing  i am sure you must feel it n    so   n     n     oh  no  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so n    full of both  i know you will do him such ample justice  that i am n    growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent  your profusion n    makes me saving  and if you lament over him much longer  my heart will n    be as light as a feather   n     n     poor wickham  there is such an expression of goodness in his n    countenance  such an openness and gentleness in his manner   n     n     there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those n    two young men  one has got all the goodness  and the other all the n    appearance of it   n     n     i never thought mr  darcy so deficient in the  appearance  of it as you n    used to do   n     n     and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike n    to him  without any reason  it is such a spur to one s genius  such an n    opening for wit  to have a dislike of that kind  one may be continually n    abusive without saying anything just  but one cannot always be laughing n    at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty   n     n     lizzy  when you first read that letter  i am sure you could not treat n    the matter as you do now   n     n     indeed  i could not  i was uncomfortable enough  i may say unhappy  and n    with no one to speak to about what i felt  no jane to comfort me and say n    that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i n    had  oh  how i wanted you   n     n     how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions n    in speaking of wickham to mr  darcy  for now they  do  appear wholly n    undeserved   n     n     certainly  but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most n    natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging  there n    is one point on which i want your advice  i want to be told whether i n    ought  or ought not  to make our acquaintances in general understand n    wickham  s character   n     n    miss bennet paused a little  and then replied   surely there can be no n    occasion for exposing him so dreadfully  what is your opinion   n     n     that it ought not to be attempted  mr  darcy has not authorised me n    to make his communication public  on the contrary  every particular n    relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to n    myself  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his n    conduct  who will believe me  the general prejudice against mr  darcy n    is so violent  that it would be the death of half the good people in n    meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light  i am not equal n    to it  wickham will soon be gone  and therefore it will not signify to n    anyone here what he really is  some time hence it will be all found out  n    and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before  at n    present i will say nothing about it   n     n     you are quite right  to have his errors made public might ruin him for n    ever  he is now  perhaps  sorry for what he has done  and anxious to n    re-establish a character  we must not make him desperate   n     n    the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation  she had n    got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight  n    and was certain of a willing listener in jane  whenever she might wish n    to talk again of either  but there was still something lurking behind  n    of which prudence forbade the disclosure  she dared not relate the other n    half of mr  darcy s letter  nor explain to her sister how sincerely she n    had been valued by her friend  here was knowledge in which no one n    could partake  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect n    understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off n    this last encumbrance of mystery   and then   said she   if that very n    improbable event should ever take place  i shall merely be able to n    tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself  the n    liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value   n     n    she was now  on being settled at home  at leisure to observe the real n    state of her sister s spirits  jane was not happy  she still cherished a n    very tender affection for bingley  having never even fancied herself n    in love before  her regard had all the warmth of first attachment  n    and  from her age and disposition  greater steadiness than most first n    attachments often boast  and so fervently did she value his remembrance  n    and prefer him to every other man  that all her good sense  and all her n    attention to the feelings of her friends  were requisite to check the n    indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own n    health and their tranquillity  n     n     well  lizzy   said mrs  bennet one day   what is your opinion  now  of n    this sad business of jane s  for my part  i am determined never to speak n    of it again to anybody  i told my sister phillips so the other day  but n    i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london  well  he is n    a very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there s the least n    chance in the world of her ever getting him now  there is no talk of n    his coming to netherfield again in the summer  and i have inquired of n    everybody  too  who is likely to know   n     n     i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more   n     n     oh well  it is just as he chooses  nobody wants him to come  though i n    shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill  and if i was her  i n    would not have put up with it  well  my comfort is  i am sure jane will n    die of a broken heart  and then he will be sorry for what he has done   n     n    but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation  n    she made no answer  n     n     well  lizzy   continued her mother  soon afterwards   and so the n    collinses live very comfortable  do they  well  well  i only hope n    it will last  and what sort of table do they keep  charlotte is an n    excellent manager  i dare say  if she is half as sharp as her n    mother  she is saving enough  there is nothing extravagant in  their  n    housekeeping  i dare say   n     n     no  nothing at all   n     n     a great deal of good management  depend upon it  yes  yes   they  will n    take care not to outrun their income   they  will never be distressed n    for money  well  much good may it do them  and so  i suppose  they often n    talk of having longbourn when your father is dead  they look upon it as n    quite their own  i dare say  whenever that happens   n     n     it was a subject which they could not mention before me   n     n     no  it would have been strange if they had  but i make no doubt they n    often talk of it between themselves  well  if they can be easy with an n    estate that is not lawfully their own  so much the better  i should be n    ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me   n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    the first week of their return was soon gone  the second began  it was n    the last of the regiment s stay in meryton  and all the young ladies n    in the neighbourhood were drooping apace  the dejection was almost n    universal  the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat  drink  n    and sleep  and pursue the usual course of their employments  very n    frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and n    lydia  whose own misery was extreme  and who could not comprehend such n    hard-heartedness in any of the family  n     n     good heaven  what is to become of us  what are we to do   would they n    often exclaim in the bitterness of woe   how can you be smiling so  n    lizzy   n     n    their affectionate mother shared all their grief  she remembered what n    she had herself endured on a similar occasion  five-and-twenty years n    ago  n     n     i am sure   said she   i cried for two days together when colonel n    miller  s regiment went away  i thought i should have broken my heart   n     n     i am sure i shall break  mine    said lydia  n     n     if one could but go to brighton   observed mrs  bennet  n     n     oh  yes --if one could but go to brighton  but papa is so n    disagreeable   n     n     a little sea-bathing would set me up forever   n     n     and my aunt phillips is sure it would do  me  a great deal of good   n    added kitty  n     n    such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through n    longbourn house  elizabeth tried to be diverted by them  but all sense n    of pleasure was lost in shame  she felt anew the justice of mr  darcy s n    objections  and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his n    interference in the views of his friend  n     n    but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away  for she n    received an invitation from mrs  forster  the wife of the colonel of n    the regiment  to accompany her to brighton  this invaluable friend was a n    very young woman  and very lately married  a resemblance in good humour n    and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other  and out of n    their  three  months  acquaintance they had been intimate  two   n     n    the rapture of lydia on this occasion  her adoration of mrs  forster  n    the delight of mrs  bennet  and the mortification of kitty  are scarcely n    to be described  wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings  lydia n    flew about the house in restless ecstasy  calling for everyone s n    congratulations  and laughing and talking with more violence than ever  n    whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate n    in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish  n     n     i cannot see why mrs  forster should not ask  me  as well as lydia   n    said she   though i am  not  her particular friend  i have just as much n    right to be asked as she has  and more too  for i am two years older   n     n    in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable  and jane to make n    her resigned  as for elizabeth herself  this invitation was so far from n    exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia  that she n    considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense n    for the latter  and detestable as such a step must make her were it n    known  she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her n    go  she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general n    behaviour  the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of n    such a woman as mrs  forster  and the probability of her being yet more n    imprudent with such a companion at brighton  where the temptations must n    be greater than at home  he heard her attentively  and then said  n     n     lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public n    place or other  and we can never expect her to do it with so n    little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present n    circumstances   n     n     if you were aware   said elizabeth   of the very great disadvantage to n    us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and n    imprudent manner--nay  which has already arisen from it  i am sure you n    would judge differently in the affair   n     n     already arisen   repeated mr  bennet   what  has she frightened away n    some of your lovers  poor little lizzy  but do not be cast down  such n    squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity n    are not worth a regret  come  let me see the list of pitiful fellows who n    have been kept aloof by lydia  s folly   n     n     indeed you are mistaken  i have no such injuries to resent  it is not n    of particular  but of general evils  which i am now complaining  our n    importance  our respectability in the world must be affected by the n    wild volatility  the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark n    lydia s character  excuse me  for i must speak plainly  if you  my dear n    father  will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits  and n    of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of n    her life  she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment  her character n    will be fixed  and she will  at sixteen  be the most determined flirt n    that ever made herself or her family ridiculous  a flirt  too  in the n    worst and meanest degree of flirtation  without any attraction beyond n    youth and a tolerable person  and  from the ignorance and emptiness n    of her mind  wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal n    contempt which her rage for admiration will excite  in this danger n    kitty also is comprehended  she will follow wherever lydia leads  vain  n    ignorant  idle  and absolutely uncontrolled  oh  my dear father  can you n    suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever n    they are known  and that their sisters will not be often involved in the n    disgrace   n     n    mr  bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject  and n    affectionately taking her hand said in reply  n     n     do not make yourself uneasy  my love  wherever you and jane are known n    you must be respected and valued  and you will not appear to less n    advantage for having a couple of--or i may say  three--very silly n    sisters  we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to n    brighton  let her go  then  colonel forster is a sensible man  and will n    keep her out of any real mischief  and she is luckily too poor to be an n    object of prey to anybody  at brighton she will be of less importance n    even as a common flirt than she has been here  the officers will find n    women better worth their notice  let us hope  therefore  that her being n    there may teach her her own insignificance  at any rate  she cannot grow n    many degrees worse  without authorising us to lock her up for the rest n    of her life   n     n    with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content  but her own opinion n    continued the same  and she left him disappointed and sorry  it was not n    in her nature  however  to increase her vexations by dwelling on n    them  she was confident of having performed her duty  and to fret n    over unavoidable evils  or augment them by anxiety  was no part of her n    disposition  n     n    had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her n    father  their indignation would hardly have found expression in their n    united volubility  in lydia s imagination  a visit to brighton comprised n    every possibility of earthly happiness  she saw  with the creative eye n    of fancy  the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers  n    she saw herself the object of attention  to tens and to scores of them n    at present unknown  she saw all the glories of the camp--its tents n    stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines  crowded with the young n    and the gay  and dazzling with scarlet  and  to complete the view  she n    saw herself seated beneath a tent  tenderly flirting with at least six n    officers at once  n     n    had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such n    realities as these  what would have been her sensations  they could have n    been understood only by her mother  who might have felt nearly the same  n    lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy n    conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself  n     n    but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed  and their raptures n    continued  with little intermission  to the very day of lydia s leaving n    home  n     n    elizabeth was now to see mr  wickham for the last time  having been n    frequently in company with him since her return  agitation was pretty n    well over  the agitations of former partiality entirely so  she had even n    learnt to detect  in the very gentleness which had first delighted n    her  an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary  in his present n    behaviour to herself  moreover  she had a fresh source of displeasure  n    for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which n    had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve  after n    what had since passed  to provoke her  she lost all concern for him in n    finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous n    gallantry  and while she steadily repressed it  could not but feel the n    reproof contained in his believing  that however long  and for whatever n    cause  his attentions had been withdrawn  her vanity would be gratified  n    and her preference secured at any time by their renewal  n     n    on the very last day of the regiment s remaining at meryton  he dined  n    with other of the officers  at longbourn  and so little was elizabeth n    disposed to part from him in good humour  that on his making some n    inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford  she n    mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr  darcy s having both spent three n    weeks at rosings  and asked him  if he was acquainted with the former  n     n    he looked surprised  displeased  alarmed  but with a moment s n    recollection and a returning smile  replied  that he had formerly seen n    him often  and  after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man  n    asked her how she had liked him  her answer was warmly in his favour  n    with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added  n     n     how long did you say he was at rosings   n     n     nearly three weeks   n     n     and you saw him frequently   n     n     yes  almost every day   n     n     his manners are very different from his cousin  s   n     n     yes  very different  but i think mr  darcy improves upon acquaintance   n     n     indeed   cried mr  wickham with a look which did not escape her   and n    pray  may i ask --  but checking himself  he added  in a gayer tone   is n    it in address that he improves  has he deigned to add aught of civility n    to his ordinary style --for i dare not hope   he continued in a lower n    and more serious tone   that he is improved in essentials   n     n     oh  no   said elizabeth   in essentials  i believe  he is very much n    what he ever was   n     n    while she spoke  wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to n    rejoice over her words  or to distrust their meaning  there was a n    something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive n    and anxious attention  while she added  n     n     when i said that he improved on acquaintance  i did not mean that n    his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement  but that  from n    knowing him better  his disposition was better understood   n     n    wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated n    look  for a few minutes he was silent  till  shaking off his n    embarrassment  he turned to her again  and said in the gentlest of n    accents  n     n     you  who so well know my feeling towards mr  darcy  will readily n    comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume n    even the  appearance  of what is right  his pride  in that direction  n    may be of service  if not to himself  to many others  for it must only n    deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by  i only n    fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you  i imagine  have been n    alluding  is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt  of whose good n    opinion and judgement he stands much in awe  his fear of her has always n    operated  i know  when they were together  and a good deal is to be n    imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh  which i n    am certain he has very much at heart   n     n    elizabeth could not repress a smile at this  but she answered only by a n    slight inclination of the head  she saw that he wanted to engage her on n    the old subject of his grievances  and she was in no humour to indulge n    him  the rest of the evening passed with the  appearance   on his n    side  of usual cheerfulness  but with no further attempt to distinguish n    elizabeth  and they parted at last with mutual civility  and possibly a n    mutual desire of never meeting again  n     n    when the party broke up  lydia returned with mrs  forster to meryton  n    from whence they were to set out early the next morning  the separation n    between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic  kitty was the n    only one who shed tears  but she did weep from vexation and envy  mrs  n    bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter  n    and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the n    opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which n    there was every reason to believe would be well attended to  and in n    the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell  the more n    gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family  she could n    not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic n    comfort  her father  captivated by youth and beauty  and that appearance n    of good humour which youth and beauty generally give  had married a n    woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in n    their marriage put an end to all real affection for her  respect  n    esteem  and confidence had vanished for ever  and all his views n    of domestic happiness were overthrown  but mr  bennet was not of n    a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own n    imprudence had brought on  in any of those pleasures which too often n    console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice  he was fond of n    the country and of books  and from these tastes had arisen his principal n    enjoyments  to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted  than as n    her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement  this is not n    the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his n    wife  but where other powers of entertainment are wanting  the true n    philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given  n     n    elizabeth  however  had never been blind to the impropriety of her n    father s behaviour as a husband  she had always seen it with pain  but n    respecting his abilities  and grateful for his affectionate treatment of n    herself  she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook  and to n    banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation n    and decorum which  in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own n    children  was so highly reprehensible  but she had never felt so n    strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so n    unsuitable a marriage  nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising n    from so ill-judged a direction of talents  talents  which  rightly used  n    might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters  even n    if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife  n     n    when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found little n    other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment  their parties n    abroad were less varied than before  and at home she had a mother and n    sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around n    them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle  and  though kitty n    might in time regain her natural degree of sense  since the disturbers n    of her brain were removed  her other sister  from whose disposition n    greater evil might be apprehended  was likely to be hardened in all n    her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a n    watering-place and a camp  upon the whole  therefore  she found  what n    has been sometimes found before  that an event to which she had been n    looking with impatient desire did not  in taking place  bring all the n    satisfaction she had promised herself  it was consequently necessary to n    name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have n    some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed  and by n    again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation  console herself for the n    present  and prepare for another disappointment  her tour to the lakes n    was now the object of her happiest thoughts  it was her best consolation n    for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother n    and kitty made inevitable  and could she have included jane in the n    scheme  every part of it would have been perfect  n     n     but it is fortunate   thought she   that i have something to wish for  n    were the whole arrangement complete  my disappointment would be certain  n    but here  by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my n    sister s absence  i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of n    pleasure realised  a scheme of which every part promises delight can n    never be successful  and general disappointment is only warded off by n    the defence of some little peculiar vexation   n     n    when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely n    to her mother and kitty  but her letters were always long expected  and n    always very short  those to her mother contained little else than that n    they were just returned from the library  where such and such officers n    had attended them  and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as n    made her quite wild  that she had a new gown  or a new parasol  which n    she would have described more fully  but was obliged to leave off in a n    violent hurry  as mrs  forster called her  and they were going off to n    the camp  and from her correspondence with her sister  there was still n    less to be learnt--for her letters to kitty  though rather longer  were n    much too full of lines under the words to be made public  n     n    after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence  health  good n    humour  and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn  everything wore n    a happier aspect  the families who had been in town for the winter came n    back again  and summer finery and summer engagements arose  mrs  bennet n    was restored to her usual querulous serenity  and  by the middle of n    june  kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without n    tears  an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by n    the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to n    mention an officer above once a day  unless  by some cruel and malicious n    arrangement at the war office  another regiment should be quartered in n    meryton  n     n    the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast n    approaching  and a fortnight only was wanting of it  when a letter n    arrived from mrs  gardiner  which at once delayed its commencement and n    curtailed its extent  mr  gardiner would be prevented by business from n    setting out till a fortnight later in july  and must be in london again n    within a month  and as that left too short a period for them to go so n    far  and see so much as they had proposed  or at least to see it with n    the leisure and comfort they had built on  they were obliged to give up n    the lakes  and substitute a more contracted tour  and  according to the n    present plan  were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire  in that n    county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three n    weeks  and to mrs  gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction  the n    town where she had formerly passed some years of her life  and where n    they were now to spend a few days  was probably as great an object of n    her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock  chatsworth  n    dovedale  or the peak  n     n    elizabeth was excessively disappointed  she had set her heart on seeing n    the lakes  and still thought there might have been time enough  but it n    was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy  n    and all was soon right again  n     n    with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected  it was n    impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its n    owner   but surely   said she   i may enter his county with impunity  n    and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me   n     n    the period of expectation was now doubled  four weeks were to pass away n    before her uncle and aunt s arrival  but they did pass away  and mr  n    and mrs  gardiner  with their four children  did at length appear at n    longbourn  the children  two girls of six and eight years old  and two n    younger boys  were to be left under the particular care of their n    cousin jane  who was the general favourite  and whose steady sense and n    sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every n    way--teaching them  playing with them  and loving them  n     n    the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn  and set off the n    next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement  n    one enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions  n    a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear n    inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection n    and intelligence  which might supply it among themselves if there were n    disappointments abroad  n     n    it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire  n    nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither n    lay  oxford  blenheim  warwick  kenilworth  birmingham  etc  are n    sufficiently known  a small part of derbyshire is all the present n    concern  to the little town of lambton  the scene of mrs  gardiner s n    former residence  and where she had lately learned some acquaintance n    still remained  they bent their steps  after having seen all the n    principal wonders of the country  and within five miles of lambton  n    elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated  it was not n    in their direct road  nor more than a mile or two out of it  in n    talking over their route the evening before  mrs  gardiner expressed n    an inclination to see the place again  mr  gardiner declared his n    willingness  and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation  n     n     my love  should not you like to see a place of which you have heard n    so much   said her aunt   a place  too  with which so many of your n    acquaintances are connected  wickham passed all his youth there  you n    know   n     n    elizabeth was distressed  she felt that she had no business at n    pemberley  and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it  she n    must own that she was tired of seeing great houses  after going over so n    many  she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains  n     n    mrs  gardiner abused her stupidity   if it were merely a fine house n    richly furnished   said she   i should not care about it myself  but n    the grounds are delightful  they have some of the finest woods in the n    country   n     n    elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce  the n    possibility of meeting mr  darcy  while viewing the place  instantly n    occurred  it would be dreadful  she blushed at the very idea  and n    thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such n    a risk  but against this there were objections  and she finally resolved n    that it could be the last resource  if her private inquiries to the n    absence of the family were unfavourably answered  n     n    accordingly  when she retired at night  she asked the chambermaid n    whether pemberley were not a very fine place  what was the name of its n    proprietor  and  with no little alarm  whether the family were down for n    the summer  a most welcome negative followed the last question--and her n    alarms now being removed  she was at leisure to feel a great deal of n    curiosity to see the house herself  and when the subject was revived the n    next morning  and she was again applied to  could readily answer  and n    with a proper air of indifference  that she had not really any dislike n    to the scheme  to pemberley  therefore  they were to go  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth  as they drove along  watched for the first appearance of n    pemberley woods with some perturbation  and when at length they turned n    in at the lodge  her spirits were in a high flutter  n     n    the park was very large  and contained great variety of ground  they n    entered it in one of its lowest points  and drove for some time through n    a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent  n     n    elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation  but she saw and admired n    every remarkable spot and point of view  they gradually ascended for n    half-a-mile  and then found themselves at the top of a considerable n    eminence  where the wood ceased  and the eye was instantly caught by n    pemberley house  situated on the opposite side of a valley  into which n    the road with some abruptness wound  it was a large  handsome stone n    building  standing well on rising ground  and backed by a ridge of n    high woody hills  and in front  a stream of some natural importance was n    swelled into greater  but without any artificial appearance  its banks n    were neither formal nor falsely adorned  elizabeth was delighted  she n    had never seen a place for which nature had done more  or where natural n    beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste  they were n    all of them warm in their admiration  and at that moment she felt that n    to be mistress of pemberley might be something  n     n    they descended the hill  crossed the bridge  and drove to the door  and  n    while examining the nearer aspect of the house  all her apprehension of n    meeting its owner returned  she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been n    mistaken  on applying to see the place  they were admitted into the n    hall  and elizabeth  as they waited for the housekeeper  had leisure to n    wonder at her being where she was  n     n    the housekeeper came  a respectable-looking elderly woman  much less n    fine  and more civil  than she had any notion of finding her  they n    followed her into the dining-parlour  it was a large  well proportioned n    room  handsomely fitted up  elizabeth  after slightly surveying it  went n    to a window to enjoy its prospect  the hill  crowned with wood  which n    they had descended  receiving increased abruptness from the distance  n    was a beautiful object  every disposition of the ground was good  and n    she looked on the whole scene  the river  the trees scattered on its n    banks and the winding of the valley  as far as she could trace it  n    with delight  as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking n    different positions  but from every window there were beauties to be n    seen  the rooms were lofty and handsome  and their furniture suitable to n    the fortune of its proprietor  but elizabeth saw  with admiration of n    his taste  that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine  with less of n    splendour  and more real elegance  than the furniture of rosings  n     n     and of this place   thought she   i might have been mistress  with n    these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted  instead of n    viewing them as a stranger  i might have rejoiced in them as my own  and n    welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt  but no  --recollecting n    herself-- that could never be  my uncle and aunt would have been lost to n    me  i should not have been allowed to invite them   n     n    this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like n    regret  n     n    she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really n    absent  but had not the courage for it  at length however  the question n    was asked by her uncle  and she turned away with alarm  while mrs  n    reynolds replied that he was  adding   but we expect him to-morrow  with n    a large party of friends   how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own n    journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day  n     n    her aunt now called her to look at a picture  she approached and saw the n    likeness of mr  wickham  suspended  amongst several other miniatures  n    over the mantelpiece  her aunt asked her  smilingly  how she liked it  n    the housekeeper came forward  and told them it was a picture of a young n    gentleman  the son of her late master s steward  who had been brought n    up by him at his own expense   he is now gone into the army   she added  n     but i am afraid he has turned out very wild   n     n    mrs  gardiner looked at her niece with a smile  but elizabeth could not n    return it  n     n     and that   said mrs  reynolds  pointing to another of the miniatures  n     is my master--and very like him  it was drawn at the same time as the n    other--about eight years ago   n     n     i have heard much of your master  s fine person   said mrs  gardiner  n    looking at the picture   it is a handsome face  but  lizzy  you can tell n    us whether it is like or not   n     n    mrs  reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this n    intimation of her knowing her master  n     n     does that young lady know mr  darcy   n     n    elizabeth coloured  and said   a little   n     n     and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman  ma  am   n     n     yes  very handsome   n     n     i am sure i know none so handsome  but in the gallery up stairs you n    will see a finer  larger picture of him than this  this room was my late n    master s favourite room  and these miniatures are just as they used to n    be then  he was very fond of them   n     n    this accounted to elizabeth for mr  wickham s being among them  n     n    mrs  reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy  drawn n    when she was only eight years old  n     n     and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother   said mrs  gardiner  n     n     oh  yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen  and so n    accomplished --she plays and sings all day long  in the next room is n    a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master  she n    comes here to-morrow with him   n     n    mr  gardiner  whose manners were very easy and pleasant  encouraged her n    communicativeness by his questions and remarks  mrs  reynolds  either n    by pride or attachment  had evidently great pleasure in talking of her n    master and his sister  n     n     is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year   n     n     not so much as i could wish  sir  but i dare say he may spend half his n    time here  and miss darcy is always down for the summer months   n     n     except   thought elizabeth   when she goes to ramsgate   n     n     if your master would marry  you might see more of him   n     n     yes  sir  but i do not know when  that  will be  i do not know who is n    good enough for him   n     n    mr  and mrs  gardiner smiled  elizabeth could not help saying   it is n    very much to his credit  i am sure  that you should think so   n     n     i say no more than the truth  and everybody will say that knows him   n    replied the other  elizabeth thought this was going pretty far  and she n    listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added   i have n    never known a cross word from him in my life  and i have known him ever n    since he was four years old   n     n    this was praise  of all others most extraordinary  most opposite to her n    ideas  that he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion  n    her keenest attention was awakened  she longed to hear more  and was n    grateful to her uncle for saying  n     n     there are very few people of whom so much can be said  you are lucky in n    having such a master   n     n     yes  sir  i know i am  if i were to go through the world  i could n    not meet with a better  but i have always observed  that they who are n    good-natured when children  are good-natured when they grow up  and n    he was always the sweetest-tempered  most generous-hearted boy in the n    world   n     n    elizabeth almost stared at her   can this be mr  darcy   thought she  n     n     his father was an excellent man   said mrs  gardiner  n     n     yes  ma  am  that he was indeed  and his son will be just like him--just n    as affable to the poor   n     n    elizabeth listened  wondered  doubted  and was impatient for more  mrs  n    reynolds could interest her on no other point  she related the subjects n    of the pictures  the dimensions of the rooms  and the price of the n    furniture  in vain  mr  gardiner  highly amused by the kind of family n    prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her n    master  soon led again to the subject  and she dwelt with energy on his n    many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase  n     n     he is the best landlord  and the best master   said she   that ever n    lived  not like the wild young men nowadays  who think of nothing but n    themselves  there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give n    him a good name  some people call him proud  but i am sure i never saw n    anything of it  to my fancy  it is only because he does not rattle away n    like other young men   n     n     in what an amiable light does this place him   thought elizabeth  n     n     this fine account of him   whispered her aunt as they walked   is not n    quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend   n     n     perhaps we might be deceived   n     n     that is not very likely  our authority was too good   n     n    on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty n    sitting-room  lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than n    the apartments below  and were informed that it was but just done to n    give pleasure to miss darcy  who had taken a liking to the room when n    last at pemberley  n     n     he is certainly a good brother   said elizabeth  as she walked towards n    one of the windows  n     n    mrs  reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight  when she should enter n    the room   and this is always the way with him   she added   whatever n    can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment  there n    is nothing he would not do for her   n     n    the picture-gallery  and two or three of the principal bedrooms  were n    all that remained to be shown  in the former were many good paintings  n    but elizabeth knew nothing of the art  and from such as had been already n    visible below  she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss n    darcy s  in crayons  whose subjects were usually more interesting  and n    also more intelligible  n     n    in the gallery there were many family portraits  but they could have n    little to fix the attention of a stranger  elizabeth walked in quest of n    the only face whose features would be known to her  at last it arrested n    her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr  darcy  with such a n    smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he n    looked at her  she stood several minutes before the picture  in earnest n    contemplation  and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery  n    mrs  reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s n    lifetime  n     n    there was certainly at this moment  in elizabeth s mind  a more gentle n    sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of n    their acquaintance  the commendation bestowed on him by mrs  reynolds n    was of no trifling nature  what praise is more valuable than the praise n    of an intelligent servant  as a brother  a landlord  a master  she n    considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship --how n    much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow --how much of n    good or evil must be done by him  every idea that had been brought n    forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character  and as she n    stood before the canvas on which he was represented  and fixed his n    eyes upon herself  she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of n    gratitude than it had ever raised before  she remembered its warmth  and n    softened its impropriety of expression  n     n    when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen  n    they returned downstairs  and  taking leave of the housekeeper  were n    consigned over to the gardener  who met them at the hall-door  n     n    as they walked across the hall towards the river  elizabeth turned back n    to look again  her uncle and aunt stopped also  and while the former n    was conjecturing as to the date of the building  the owner of it himself n    suddenly came forward from the road  which led behind it to the stables  n     n    they were within twenty yards of each other  and so abrupt was his n    appearance  that it was impossible to avoid his sight  their eyes n    instantly met  and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest n    blush  he absolutely started  and for a moment seemed immovable from n    surprise  but shortly recovering himself  advanced towards the party  n    and spoke to elizabeth  if not in terms of perfect composure  at least n    of perfect civility  n     n    she had instinctively turned away  but stopping on his approach  n    received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be n    overcome  had his first appearance  or his resemblance to the picture n    they had just been examining  been insufficient to assure the other two n    that they now saw mr  darcy  the gardener s expression of surprise  on n    beholding his master  must immediately have told it  they stood a little n    aloof while he was talking to their niece  who  astonished and confused  n    scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face  and knew not what answer n    she returned to his civil inquiries after her family  amazed at the n    alteration of his manner since they last parted  every sentence that n    he uttered was increasing her embarrassment  and every idea of the n    impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind  the few n    minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in n    her life  nor did he seem much more at ease  when he spoke  his accent n    had none of its usual sedateness  and he repeated his inquiries as n    to the time of her having left longbourn  and of her having stayed in n    derbyshire  so often  and in so hurried a way  as plainly spoke the n    distraction of his thoughts  n     n    at length every idea seemed to fail him  and  after standing a few n    moments without saying a word  he suddenly recollected himself  and took n    leave  n     n    the others then joined her  and expressed admiration of his figure  but n    elizabeth heard not a word  and wholly engrossed by her own feelings  n    followed them in silence  she was overpowered by shame and vexation  her n    coming there was the most unfortunate  the most ill-judged thing in the n    world  how strange it must appear to him  in what a disgraceful light n    might it not strike so vain a man  it might seem as if she had purposely n    thrown herself in his way again  oh  why did she come  or  why did he n    thus come a day before he was expected  had they been only ten minutes n    sooner  they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination  n    for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted n    from his horse or his carriage  she blushed again and again over n    the perverseness of the meeting  and his behaviour  so strikingly n    altered--what could it mean  that he should even speak to her was n    amazing --but to speak with such civility  to inquire after her family  n    never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified  never n    had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting  what n    a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park  when he put n    his letter into her hand  she knew not what to think  or how to account n    for it  n     n    they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water  and n    every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground  or a finer n    reach of the woods to which they were approaching  but it was some time n    before elizabeth was sensible of any of it  and  though she answered n    mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt  and n    seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out  she n    distinguished no part of the scene  her thoughts were all fixed on that n    one spot of pemberley house  whichever it might be  where mr  darcy then n    was  she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in n    what manner he thought of her  and whether  in defiance of everything  n    she was still dear to him  perhaps he had been civil only because he n    felt himself at ease  yet there had been  that  in his voice which was n    not like ease  whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in n    seeing her she could not tell  but he certainly had not seen her with n    composure  n     n    at length  however  the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind n    aroused her  and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself  n     n    they entered the woods  and bidding adieu to the river for a while  n    ascended some of the higher grounds  when  in spots where the opening of n    the trees gave the eye power to wander  were many charming views of the n    valley  the opposite hills  with the long range of woods overspreading n    many  and occasionally part of the stream  mr  gardiner expressed a wish n    of going round the whole park  but feared it might be beyond a walk  n    with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round  n    it settled the matter  and they pursued the accustomed circuit  which n    brought them again  after some time  in a descent among hanging woods  n    to the edge of the water  and one of its narrowest parts  they crossed n    it by a simple bridge  in character with the general air of the scene  n    it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited  and the n    valley  here contracted into a glen  allowed room only for the stream  n    and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it  n    elizabeth longed to explore its windings  but when they had crossed the n    bridge  and perceived their distance from the house  mrs  gardiner  n    who was not a great walker  could go no farther  and thought only n    of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible  her niece was  n    therefore  obliged to submit  and they took their way towards the house n    on the opposite side of the river  in the nearest direction  but their n    progress was slow  for mr  gardiner  though seldom able to indulge the n    taste  was very fond of fishing  and was so much engaged in watching the n    occasional appearance of some trout in the water  and talking to the n    man about them  that he advanced but little  whilst wandering on in this n    slow manner  they were again surprised  and elizabeth s astonishment n    was quite equal to what it had been at first  by the sight of mr  darcy n    approaching them  and at no great distance  the walk being here n    less sheltered than on the other side  allowed them to see him before n    they met  elizabeth  however astonished  was at least more prepared n    for an interview than before  and resolved to appear and to speak with n    calmness  if he really intended to meet them  for a few moments  indeed  n    she felt that he would probably strike into some other path  the idea n    lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view  the n    turning past  he was immediately before them  with a glance  she saw n    that he had lost none of his recent civility  and  to imitate his n    politeness  she began  as they met  to admire the beauty of the place  n    but she had not got beyond the words  delightful   and  charming   when n    some unlucky recollections obtruded  and she fancied that praise of n    pemberley from her might be mischievously construed  her colour changed  n    and she said no more  n     n    mrs  gardiner was standing a little behind  and on her pausing  he asked n    her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends  n    this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared  n    and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the n    acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had n    revolted in his offer to herself   what will be his surprise   thought n    she   when he knows who they are  he takes them now for people of n    fashion   n     n    the introduction  however  was immediately made  and as she named their n    relationship to herself  she stole a sly look at him  to see how he bore n    it  and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he n    could from such disgraceful companions  that he was  surprised  by the n    connection was evident  he sustained it  however  with fortitude  and n    so far from going away  turned back with them  and entered into n    conversation with mr  gardiner  elizabeth could not but be pleased  n    could not but triumph  it was consoling that he should know she had n    some relations for whom there was no need to blush  she listened most n    attentively to all that passed between them  and gloried in every n    expression  every sentence of her uncle  which marked his intelligence  n    his taste  or his good manners  n     n    the conversation soon turned upon fishing  and she heard mr  darcy n    invite him  with the greatest civility  to fish there as often as he n    chose while he continued in the neighbourhood  offering at the same time n    to supply him with fishing tackle  and pointing out those parts of n    the stream where there was usually most sport  mrs  gardiner  who was n    walking arm-in-arm with elizabeth  gave her a look expressive of wonder  n    elizabeth said nothing  but it gratified her exceedingly  the compliment n    must be all for herself  her astonishment  however  was extreme  and n    continually was she repeating   why is he so altered  from what can n    it proceed  it cannot be for  me --it cannot be for  my  sake that his n    manners are thus softened  my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a n    change as this  it is impossible that he should still love me   n     n    after walking some time in this way  the two ladies in front  the two n    gentlemen behind  on resuming their places  after descending to n    the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious n    water-plant  there chanced to be a little alteration  it originated n    in mrs  gardiner  who  fatigued by the exercise of the morning  found n    elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support  and consequently preferred n    her husband s  mr  darcy took her place by her niece  and they walked on n    together  after a short silence  the lady first spoke  she wished him n    to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the n    place  and accordingly began by observing  that his arrival had been n    very unexpected-- for your housekeeper   she added   informed us that n    you would certainly not be here till to-morrow  and indeed  before we n    left bakewell  we understood that you were not immediately expected n    in the country   he acknowledged the truth of it all  and said that n    business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours n    before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling   they n    will join me early to-morrow   he continued   and among them are some n    who will claim an acquaintance with you--mr  bingley and his sisters   n     n    elizabeth answered only by a slight bow  her thoughts were instantly n    driven back to the time when mr  bingley s name had been the last n    mentioned between them  and  if she might judge by his complexion   his  n    mind was not very differently engaged  n     n     there is also one other person in the party   he continued after a n    pause   who more particularly wishes to be known to you  will you allow n    me  or do i ask too much  to introduce my sister to your acquaintance n    during your stay at lambton   n     n    the surprise of such an application was great indeed  it was too great n    for her to know in what manner she acceded to it  she immediately felt n    that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her n    must be the work of her brother  and  without looking farther  it was n    satisfactory  it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made n    him think really ill of her  n     n    they now walked on in silence  each of them deep in thought  elizabeth n    was not comfortable  that was impossible  but she was flattered and n    pleased  his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of n    the highest kind  they soon outstripped the others  and when they had n    reached the carriage  mr  and mrs  gardiner were half a quarter of a n    mile behind  n     n    he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not n    tired  and they stood together on the lawn  at such a time much might n    have been said  and silence was very awkward  she wanted to talk  but n    there seemed to be an embargo on every subject  at last she recollected n    that she had been travelling  and they talked of matlock and dove dale n    with great perseverance  yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her n    patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was n    over  on mr  and mrs  gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go n    into the house and take some refreshment  but this was declined  and n    they parted on each side with utmost politeness  mr  darcy handed the n    ladies into the carriage  and when it drove off  elizabeth saw him n    walking slowly towards the house  n     n    the observations of her uncle and aunt now began  and each of them n    pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected  n     he is perfectly well behaved  polite  and unassuming   said her uncle  n     n     there  is  something a little stately in him  to be sure   replied her n    aunt   but it is confined to his air  and is not unbecoming  i can now n    say with the housekeeper  that though some people may call him proud  i n    have seen nothing of it   n     n     i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us  it was more n    than civil  it was really attentive  and there was no necessity for such n    attention  his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling   n     n     to be sure  lizzy   said her aunt   he is not so handsome as wickham  n    or  rather  he has not wickham s countenance  for his features n    are perfectly good  but how came you to tell me that he was so n    disagreeable   n     n    elizabeth excused herself as well as she could  said that she had liked n    him better when they had met in kent than before  and that she had never n    seen him so pleasant as this morning  n     n     but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities   replied n    her uncle   your great men often are  and therefore i shall not take him n    at his word  as he might change his mind another day  and warn me off n    his grounds   n     n    elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character  but n    said nothing  n     n     from what we have seen of him   continued mrs  gardiner   i really n    should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by n    anybody as he has done by poor wickham  he has not an ill-natured look  n    on the contrary  there is something pleasing about his mouth when he n    speaks  and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would n    not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart  but  to be sure  the n    good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character  n    i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes  but he is a liberal n    master  i suppose  and  that  in the eye of a servant comprehends every n    virtue   n     n    elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of n    his behaviour to wickham  and therefore gave them to understand  in n    as guarded a manner as she could  that by what she had heard from n    his relations in kent  his actions were capable of a very different n    construction  and that his character was by no means so faulty  nor n    wickham s so amiable  as they had been considered in hertfordshire  in n    confirmation of this  she related the particulars of all the pecuniary n    transactions in which they had been connected  without actually naming n    her authority  but stating it to be such as might be relied on  n     n    mrs  gardiner was surprised and concerned  but as they were now n    approaching the scene of her former pleasures  every idea gave way to n    the charm of recollection  and she was too much engaged in pointing out n    to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of n    anything else  fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they n    had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former n    acquaintance  and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a n    intercourse renewed after many years  discontinuance  n     n    the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth n    much attention for any of these new friends  and she could do nothing n    but think  and think with wonder  of mr  darcy s civility  and  above n    all  of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth had settled it that mr  darcy would bring his sister to visit n    her the very day after her reaching pemberley  and was consequently n    resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning  n    but her conclusion was false  for on the very morning after their n    arrival at lambton  these visitors came  they had been walking about the n    place with some of their new friends  and were just returning to the inn n    to dress themselves for dining with the same family  when the sound of a n    carriage drew them to a window  and they saw a gentleman and a lady in n    a curricle driving up the street  elizabeth immediately recognizing n    the livery  guessed what it meant  and imparted no small degree of her n    surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she n    expected  her uncle and aunt were all amazement  and the embarrassment n    of her manner as she spoke  joined to the circumstance itself  and many n    of the circumstances of the preceding day  opened to them a new idea on n    the business  nothing had ever suggested it before  but they felt that n    there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a n    quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece  while these n    newly-born notions were passing in their heads  the perturbation of n    elizabeth s feelings was at every moment increasing  she was quite n    amazed at her own discomposure  but amongst other causes of disquiet  n    she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much n    in her favour  and  more than commonly anxious to please  she naturally n    suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her  n     n    she retreated from the window  fearful of being seen  and as she walked n    up and down the room  endeavouring to compose herself  saw such looks of n    inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse  n     n    miss darcy and her brother appeared  and this formidable introduction n    took place  with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new n    acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself  since her n    being at lambton  she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud  n    but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was n    only exceedingly shy  she found it difficult to obtain even a word from n    her beyond a monosyllable  n     n    miss darcy was tall  and on a larger scale than elizabeth  and  though n    little more than sixteen  her figure was formed  and her appearance n    womanly and graceful  she was less handsome than her brother  but there n    was sense and good humour in her face  and her manners were perfectly n    unassuming and gentle  elizabeth  who had expected to find in her as n    acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr  darcy had been  was much n    relieved by discerning such different feelings  n     n    they had not long been together before mr  darcy told her that bingley n    was also coming to wait on her  and she had barely time to express her n    satisfaction  and prepare for such a visitor  when bingley s quick n    step was heard on the stairs  and in a moment he entered the room  all n    elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away  but had she still n    felt any  it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected n    cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again  he n    inquired in a friendly  though general way  after her family  and looked n    and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done  n     n    to mr  and mrs  gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage n    than to herself  they had long wished to see him  the whole party before n    them  indeed  excited a lively attention  the suspicions which had just n    arisen of mr  darcy and their niece directed their observation towards n    each with an earnest though guarded inquiry  and they soon drew from n    those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew n    what it was to love  of the lady s sensations they remained a little n    in doubt  but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was n    evident enough  n     n    elizabeth  on her side  had much to do  she wanted to ascertain the n    feelings of each of her visitors  she wanted to compose her own  and n    to make herself agreeable to all  and in the latter object  where she n    feared most to fail  she was most sure of success  for those to whom she n    endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour  bingley n    was ready  georgiana was eager  and darcy determined  to be pleased  n     n    in seeing bingley  her thoughts naturally flew to her sister  and  oh  n    how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in n    a like manner  sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on n    former occasions  and once or twice pleased herself with the notion n    that  as he looked at her  he was trying to trace a resemblance  but  n    though this might be imaginary  she could not be deceived as to his n    behaviour to miss darcy  who had been set up as a rival to jane  no look n    appeared on either side that spoke particular regard  nothing occurred n    between them that could justify the hopes of his sister  on this point n    she was soon satisfied  and two or three little circumstances occurred n    ere they parted  which  in her anxious interpretation  denoted a n    recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness  and a wish of saying n    more that might lead to the mention of her  had he dared  he observed n    to her  at a moment when the others were talking together  and in a tone n    which had something of real regret  that it  was a very long time since n    he had had the pleasure of seeing her   and  before she could reply  n    he added   it is above eight months  we have not met since the   th of n    november  when we were all dancing together at netherfield   n     n    elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact  and he afterwards n    took occasion to ask her  when unattended to by any of the rest  whether n     all  her sisters were at longbourn  there was not much in the question  n    nor in the preceding remark  but there was a look and a manner which n    gave them meaning  n     n    it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr  darcy himself  n    but  whenever she did catch a glimpse  she saw an expression of general n    complaisance  and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed n    from  hauteur  or disdain of his companions  as convinced her that n    the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however n    temporary its existence might prove  had at least outlived one day  when n    she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion n    of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a n    disgrace--when she saw him thus civil  not only to herself  but to the n    very relations whom he had openly disdained  and recollected their last n    lively scene in hunsford parsonage--the difference  the change was n    so great  and struck so forcibly on her mind  that she could hardly n    restrain her astonishment from being visible  never  even in the company n    of his dear friends at netherfield  or his dignified relations n    at rosings  had she seen him so desirous to please  so free from n    self-consequence or unbending reserve  as now  when no importance n    could result from the success of his endeavours  and when even the n    acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw n    down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and n    rosings  n     n    their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour  and when they arose n    to depart  mr  darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing n    their wish of seeing mr  and mrs  gardiner  and miss bennet  to dinner n    at pemberley  before they left the country  miss darcy  though with a n    diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations  n    readily obeyed  mrs  gardiner looked at her niece  desirous of knowing n    how  she   whom the invitation most concerned  felt disposed as to its n    acceptance  but elizabeth had turned away her head  presuming however  n    that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than n    any dislike of the proposal  and seeing in her husband  who was fond of n    society  a perfect willingness to accept it  she ventured to engage for n    her attendance  and the day after the next was fixed on  n     n    bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth n    again  having still a great deal to say to her  and many inquiries to n    make after all their hertfordshire friends  elizabeth  construing all n    this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister  was pleased  and on n    this account  as well as some others  found herself  when their n    visitors left them  capable of considering the last half-hour with some n    satisfaction  though while it was passing  the enjoyment of it had been n    little  eager to be alone  and fearful of inquiries or hints from her n    uncle and aunt  she stayed with them only long enough to hear their n    favourable opinion of bingley  and then hurried away to dress  n     n    but she had no reason to fear mr  and mrs  gardiner s curiosity  it was n    not their wish to force her communication  it was evident that she was n    much better acquainted with mr  darcy than they had before any idea of  n    it was evident that he was very much in love with her  they saw much to n    interest  but nothing to justify inquiry  n     n    of mr  darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well  and  as far n    as their acquaintance reached  there was no fault to find  they could n    not be untouched by his politeness  and had they drawn his character n    from their own feelings and his servant s report  without any reference n    to any other account  the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known n    would not have recognized it for mr  darcy  there was now an interest  n    however  in believing the housekeeper  and they soon became sensible n    that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four n    years old  and whose own manners indicated respectability  was not to be n    hastily rejected  neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of n    their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight  they had n    nothing to accuse him of but pride  pride he probably had  and if not  n    it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town n    where the family did not visit  it was acknowledged  however  that he n    was a liberal man  and did much good among the poor  n     n    with respect to wickham  the travellers soon found that he was not held n    there in much estimation  for though the chief of his concerns with the n    son of his patron were imperfectly understood  it was yet a well-known n    fact that  on his quitting derbyshire  he had left many debts behind n    him  which mr  darcy afterwards discharged  n     n    as for elizabeth  her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than n    the last  and the evening  though as it passed it seemed long  was not n    long enough to determine her feelings towards  one  in that mansion  n    and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out  she n    certainly did not hate him  no  hatred had vanished long ago  and she n    had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him  n    that could be so called  the respect created by the conviction of his n    valuable qualities  though at first unwillingly admitted  had for some n    time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling  and it was now heightened n    into somewhat of a friendlier nature  by the testimony so highly in n    his favour  and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light  n    which yesterday had produced  but above all  above respect and esteem  n    there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked  n    it was gratitude  gratitude  not merely for having once loved her  n    but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and n    acrimony of her manner in rejecting him  and all the unjust accusations n    accompanying her rejection  he who  she had been persuaded  would avoid n    her as his greatest enemy  seemed  on this accidental meeting  most n    eager to preserve the acquaintance  and without any indelicate display n    of regard  or any peculiarity of manner  where their two selves only n    were concerned  was soliciting the good opinion of her friends  and bent n    on making her known to his sister  such a change in a man of so much n    pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love  ardent n    love  it must be attributed  and as such its impression on her was of a n    sort to be encouraged  as by no means unpleasing  though it could not be n    exactly defined  she respected  she esteemed  she was grateful to him  n    she felt a real interest in his welfare  and she only wanted to know how n    far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself  and how far it would n    be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power  which her n    fancy told her she still possessed  of bringing on her the renewal of n    his addresses  n     n    it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece  that n    such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to see them on the n    very day of her arrival at pemberley  for she had reached it only to a n    late breakfast  ought to be imitated  though it could not be equalled  n    by some exertion of politeness on their side  and  consequently  that n    it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following n    morning  they were  therefore  to go  elizabeth was pleased  though when n    she asked herself the reason  she had very little to say in reply  n     n    mr  gardiner left them soon after breakfast  the fishing scheme had been n    renewed the day before  and a positive engagement made of his meeting n    some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had n    originated in jealousy  she could not help feeling how unwelcome her n    appearance at pemberley must be to her  and was curious to know with how n    much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed  n     n    on reaching the house  they were shown through the hall into the saloon  n    whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer  its windows n    opening to the ground  admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody n    hills behind the house  and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts n    which were scattered over the intermediate lawn  n     n    in this house they were received by miss darcy  who was sitting there n    with mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and the lady with whom she lived in n    london  georgiana s reception of them was very civil  but attended with n    all the embarrassment which  though proceeding from shyness and the fear n    of doing wrong  would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior n    the belief of her being proud and reserved  mrs  gardiner and her niece  n    however  did her justice  and pitied her  n     n    by mrs  hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey  and  n    on their being seated  a pause  awkward as such pauses must always be  n    succeeded for a few moments  it was first broken by mrs  annesley  a n    genteel  agreeable-looking woman  whose endeavour to introduce some kind n    of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the n    others  and between her and mrs  gardiner  with occasional help from n    elizabeth  the conversation was carried on  miss darcy looked as if she n    wished for courage enough to join in it  and sometimes did venture a n    short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard  n     n    elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley  n    and that she could not speak a word  especially to miss darcy  without n    calling her attention  this observation would not have prevented her n    from trying to talk to the latter  had they not been seated at an n    inconvenient distance  but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity n    of saying much  her own thoughts were employing her  she expected every n    moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room  she wished  she n    feared that the master of the house might be amongst them  and whether n    she wished or feared it most  she could scarcely determine  after n    sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss n    bingley s voice  elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold n    inquiry after the health of her family  she answered with equal n    indifference and brevity  and the other said no more  n     n    the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the n    entrance of servants with cold meat  cake  and a variety of all the n    finest fruits in season  but this did not take place till after many n    a significant look and smile from mrs  annesley to miss darcy had been n    given  to remind her of her post  there was now employment for the whole n    party--for though they could not all talk  they could all eat  and the n    beautiful pyramids of grapes  nectarines  and peaches soon collected n    them round the table  n     n    while thus engaged  elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether n    she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr  darcy  by the n    feelings which prevailed on his entering the room  and then  though but n    a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate  she began to n    regret that he came  n     n    he had been some time with mr  gardiner  who  with two or three other n    gentlemen from the house  was engaged by the river  and had left him n    only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to n    georgiana that morning  no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely n    resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed  a resolution the more n    necessary to be made  but perhaps not the more easily kept  because she n    saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them  n    and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour n    when he first came into the room  in no countenance was attentive n    curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s  in spite of the n    smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its n    objects  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate  and her attentions n    to mr  darcy were by no means over  miss darcy  on her brother s n    entrance  exerted herself much more to talk  and elizabeth saw that he n    was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted  and forwarded n    as much as possible  every attempt at conversation on either side  miss n    bingley saw all this likewise  and  in the imprudence of anger  took the n    first opportunity of saying  with sneering civility  n     n     pray  miss eliza  are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton  n    they must be a great loss to  your  family   n     n    in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name  but elizabeth n    instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts  and the n    various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress  n    but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack  she n    presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone  while n    she spoke  an involuntary glance showed her darcy  with a heightened n    complexion  earnestly looking at her  and his sister overcome with n    confusion  and unable to lift up her eyes  had miss bingley known what n    pain she was then giving her beloved friend  she undoubtedly would n    have refrained from the hint  but she had merely intended to discompose n    elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed n    her partial  to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in n    darcy s opinion  and  perhaps  to remind the latter of all the follies n    and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected n    with that corps  not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s n    meditated elopement  to no creature had it been revealed  where secrecy n    was possible  except to elizabeth  and from all bingley s connections n    her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it  from the very n    wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him  of their becoming n    hereafter her own  he had certainly formed such a plan  and without n    meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss n    bennet  it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern n    for the welfare of his friend  n     n    elizabeth s collected behaviour  however  soon quieted his emotion  and n    as miss bingley  vexed and disappointed  dared not approach nearer to n    wickham  georgiana also recovered in time  though not enough to be able n    to speak any more  her brother  whose eye she feared to meet  scarcely n    recollected her interest in the affair  and the very circumstance which n    had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have n    fixed them on her more and more cheerfully  n     n    their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above n    mentioned  and while mr  darcy was attending them to their carriage miss n    bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person  n    behaviour  and dress  but georgiana would not join her  her brother s n    recommendation was enough to ensure her favour  his judgement could not n    err  and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana n    without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable  when n    darcy returned to the saloon  miss bingley could not help repeating to n    him some part of what she had been saying to his sister  n     n     how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning  mr  darcy   she n    cried   i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since n    the winter  she is grown so brown and coarse  louisa and i were agreeing n    that we should not have known her again   n     n    however little mr  darcy might have liked such an address  he contented n    himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than n    her being rather tanned  no miraculous consequence of travelling in the n    summer  n     n     for my own part   she rejoined   i must confess that i never could n    see any beauty in her  her face is too thin  her complexion has no n    brilliancy  and her features are not at all handsome  her nose n    wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines  her teeth are n    tolerable  but not out of the common way  and as for her eyes  n    which have sometimes been called so fine  i could never see anything n    extraordinary in them  they have a sharp  shrewish look  which i do n    not like at all  and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency n    without fashion  which is intolerable   n     n    persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth  this was not n    the best method of recommending herself  but angry people are not always n    wise  and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled  she had all the n    success she expected  he was resolutely silent  however  and  from a n    determination of making him speak  she continued  n     n     i remember  when we first knew her in hertfordshire  how amazed we all n    were to find that she was a reputed beauty  and i particularly recollect n    your saying one night  after they had been dining at netherfield    she  n    a beauty --i should as soon call her mother a wit   but afterwards she n    seemed to improve on you  and i believe you thought her rather pretty at n    one time   n     n     yes   replied darcy  who could contain himself no longer   but  that  n    was only when i first saw her  for it is many months since i have n    considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance   n     n    he then went away  and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of n    having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself  n     n    mrs  gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their n    visit  as they returned  except what had particularly interested them n    both  the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed  n    except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention  they talked n    of his sister  his friends  his house  his fruit--of everything but n    himself  yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs  gardiner thought of n    him  and mrs  gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s n    beginning the subject  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from n    jane on their first arrival at lambton  and this disappointment had been n    renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there  but n    on the third her repining was over  and her sister justified  by the n    receipt of two letters from her at once  on one of which was marked that n    it had been missent elsewhere  elizabeth was not surprised at it  as n    jane had written the direction remarkably ill  n     n    they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in  and n    her uncle and aunt  leaving her to enjoy them in quiet  set off by n    themselves  the one missent must first be attended to  it had been n    written five days ago  the beginning contained an account of all their n    little parties and engagements  with such news as the country afforded  n    but the latter half  which was dated a day later  and written in evident n    agitation  gave more important intelligence  it was to this effect  n     n     since writing the above  dearest lizzy  something has occurred of a n    most unexpected and serious nature  but i am afraid of alarming you--be n    assured that we are all well  what i have to say relates to poor lydia  n    an express came at twelve last night  just as we were all gone to bed  n    from colonel forster  to inform us that she was gone off to scotland n    with one of his officers  to own the truth  with wickham  imagine our n    surprise  to kitty  however  it does not seem so wholly unexpected  i am n    very  very sorry  so imprudent a match on both sides  but i am willing n    to hope the best  and that his character has been misunderstood  n    thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him  but this step n     and let us rejoice over it  marks nothing bad at heart  his choice is n    disinterested at least  for he must know my father can give her nothing  n    our poor mother is sadly grieved  my father bears it better  how n    thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against n    him  we must forget it ourselves  they were off saturday night about n    twelve  as is conjectured  but were not missed till yesterday morning at n    eight  the express was sent off directly  my dear lizzy  they must have n    passed within ten miles of us  colonel forster gives us reason to expect n    him here soon  lydia left a few lines for his wife  informing her of n    their intention  i must conclude  for i cannot be long from my poor n    mother  i am afraid you will not be able to make it out  but i hardly n    know what i have written   n     n    without allowing herself time for consideration  and scarcely knowing n    what she felt  elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the n    other  and opening it with the utmost impatience  read as follows  it n    had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first  n     n     by this time  my dearest sister  you have received my hurried letter  i n    wish this may be more intelligible  but though not confined for time  my n    head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent  dearest n    lizzy  i hardly know what i would write  but i have bad news for you  n    and it cannot be delayed  imprudent as the marriage between mr  wickham n    and our poor lydia would be  we are now anxious to be assured it has n    taken place  for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone n    to scotland  colonel forster came yesterday  having left brighton the n    day before  not many hours after the express  though lydia s short n    letter to mrs  f  gave them to understand that they were going to gretna n    green  something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w  n    never intended to go there  or to marry lydia at all  which was n    repeated to colonel f   who  instantly taking the alarm  set off from b  n    intending to trace their route  he did trace them easily to clapham  n    but no further  for on entering that place  they removed into a hackney n    coach  and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom  all that n    is known after this is  that they were seen to continue the london road  n    i know not what to think  after making every possible inquiry on that n    side london  colonel f  came on into hertfordshire  anxiously renewing n    them at all the turnpikes  and at the inns in barnet and hatfield  but n    without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through  with n    the kindest concern he came on to longbourn  and broke his apprehensions n    to us in a manner most creditable to his heart  i am sincerely grieved n    for him and mrs  f   but no one can throw any blame on them  our n    distress  my dear lizzy  is very great  my father and mother believe the n    worst  but i cannot think so ill of him  many circumstances might make n    it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue n    their first plan  and even if  he  could form such a design against a n    young woman of lydia s connections  which is not likely  can i suppose n    her so lost to everything  impossible  i grieve to find  however  that n    colonel f  is not disposed to depend upon their marriage  he shook his n    head when i expressed my hopes  and said he feared w  was not a man to n    be trusted  my poor mother is really ill  and keeps her room  could she n    exert herself  it would be better  but this is not to be expected  and n    as to my father  i never in my life saw him so affected  poor kitty has n    anger for having concealed their attachment  but as it was a matter of n    confidence  one cannot wonder  i am truly glad  dearest lizzy  that you n    have been spared something of these distressing scenes  but now  as the n    first shock is over  shall i own that i long for your return  i am not n    so selfish  however  as to press for it  if inconvenient  adieu  i n    take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not  but n    circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to n    come here as soon as possible  i know my dear uncle and aunt so well  n    that i am not afraid of requesting it  though i have still something n    more to ask of the former  my father is going to london with colonel n    forster instantly  to try to discover her  what he means to do i am sure n    i know not  but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any n    measure in the best and safest way  and colonel forster is obliged to n    be at brighton again to-morrow evening  in such an exigence  my n    uncle s advice and assistance would be everything in the world  he will n    immediately comprehend what i must feel  and i rely upon his goodness   n     n     oh  where  where is my uncle   cried elizabeth  darting from her seat n    as she finished the letter  in eagerness to follow him  without losing n    a moment of the time so precious  but as she reached the door it was n    opened by a servant  and mr  darcy appeared  her pale face and impetuous n    manner made him start  and before he could recover himself to speak  n    she  in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation  n    hastily exclaimed   i beg your pardon  but i must leave you  i must find n    mr  gardiner this moment  on business that cannot be delayed  i have not n    an instant to lose   n     n     good god  what is the matter   cried he  with more feeling than n    politeness  then recollecting himself   i will not detain you a minute  n    but let me  or let the servant go after mr  and mrs  gardiner  you are n    not well enough  you cannot go yourself   n     n    elizabeth hesitated  but her knees trembled under her and she felt how n    little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them  calling back n    the servant  therefore  she commissioned him  though in so breathless n    an accent as made her almost unintelligible  to fetch his master and n    mistress home instantly  n     n    on his quitting the room she sat down  unable to support herself  and n    looking so miserably ill  that it was impossible for darcy to leave her  n    or to refrain from saying  in a tone of gentleness and commiseration  n     let me call your maid  is there nothing you could take to give you n    present relief  a glass of wine  shall i get you one  you are very ill   n     n     no  i thank you   she replied  endeavouring to recover herself   there n    is nothing the matter with me  i am quite well  i am only distressed by n    some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn   n     n    she burst into tears as she alluded to it  and for a few minutes could n    not speak another word  darcy  in wretched suspense  could only say n    something indistinctly of his concern  and observe her in compassionate n    silence  at length she spoke again   i have just had a letter from jane  n    with such dreadful news  it cannot be concealed from anyone  my younger n    sister has left all her friends--has eloped  has thrown herself into n    the power of--of mr  wickham  they are gone off together from brighton  n     you  know him too well to doubt the rest  she has no money  no n    connections  nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever   n     n    darcy was fixed in astonishment   when i consider   she added in a yet n    more agitated voice   that i might have prevented it  i  who knew what n    he was  had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what i n    learnt  to my own family  had his character been known  this could not n    have happened  but it is all--all too late now   n     n     i am grieved indeed   cried darcy   grieved--shocked  but is it n    certain--absolutely certain   n     n     oh  yes  they left brighton together on sunday night  and were traced n    almost to london  but not beyond  they are certainly not gone to n    scotland   n     n     and what has been done  what has been attempted  to recover her   n     n     my father is gone to london  and jane has written to beg my uncle  s n    immediate assistance  and we shall be off  i hope  in half-an-hour  but n    nothing can be done--i know very well that nothing can be done  how is n    such a man to be worked on  how are they even to be discovered  i have n    not the smallest hope  it is every way horrible   n     n    darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence  n     n     when  my  eyes were opened to his real character--oh  had i known what n    i ought  what i dared to do  but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too n    much  wretched  wretched mistake   n     n    darcy made no answer  he seemed scarcely to hear her  and was walking n    up and down the room in earnest meditation  his brow contracted  his air n    gloomy  elizabeth soon observed  and instantly understood it  her n    power was sinking  everything  must  sink under such a proof of family n    weakness  such an assurance of the deepest disgrace  she could neither n    wonder nor condemn  but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing n    consolatory to her bosom  afforded no palliation of her distress  it n    was  on the contrary  exactly calculated to make her understand her own n    wishes  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved n    him  as now  when all love must be vain  n     n    but self  though it would intrude  could not engross her  lydia--the n    humiliation  the misery she was bringing on them all  soon swallowed n    up every private care  and covering her face with her handkerchief  n    elizabeth was soon lost to everything else  and  after a pause of n    several minutes  was only recalled to a sense of her situation by n    the voice of her companion  who  in a manner which  though it spoke n    compassion  spoke likewise restraint  said   i am afraid you have been n    long desiring my absence  nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my n    stay  but real  though unavailing concern  would to heaven that anything n    could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to n    such distress  but i will not torment you with vain wishes  which may n    seem purposely to ask for your thanks  this unfortunate affair will  i n    fear  prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley n    to-day   n     n     oh  yes  be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy  say that n    urgent business calls us home immediately  conceal the unhappy truth as n    long as it is possible  i know it cannot be long   n     n    he readily assured her of his secrecy  again expressed his sorrow for n    her distress  wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present n    reason to hope  and leaving his compliments for her relations  with only n    one serious  parting look  went away  n     n    as he quitted the room  elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they n    should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as n    had marked their several meetings in derbyshire  and as she threw a n    retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance  so full n    of contradictions and varieties  sighed at the perverseness of those n    feelings which would now have promoted its continuance  and would n    formerly have rejoiced in its termination  n     n    if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection  elizabeth s n    change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty  but if n    otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or n    unnatural  in comparison of what is so often described as arising on n    a first interview with its object  and even before two words have been n    exchanged  nothing can be said in her defence  except that she had given n    somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham  n    and that its ill success might  perhaps  authorise her to seek the other n    less interesting mode of attachment  be that as it may  she saw him n    go with regret  and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must n    produce  found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched n    business  never  since reading jane s second letter  had she entertained n    a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her  no one but jane  she thought  n    could flatter herself with such an expectation  surprise was the least n    of her feelings on this development  while the contents of the first n    letter remained in her mind  she was all surprise--all astonishment that n    wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry n    for money  and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared n    incomprehensible  but now it was all too natural  for such an attachment n    as this she might have sufficient charms  and though she did not suppose n    lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention n    of marriage  she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue n    nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey  n     n    she had never perceived  while the regiment was in hertfordshire  that n    lydia had any partiality for him  but she was convinced that lydia n    wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody  sometimes one n    officer  sometimes another  had been her favourite  as their attentions n    raised them in her opinion  her affections had continually been n    fluctuating but never without an object  the mischief of neglect and n    mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh  how acutely did she now n    feel it  n     n    she was wild to be at home--to hear  to see  to be upon the spot to n    share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her  in a n    family so deranged  a father absent  a mother incapable of exertion  and n    requiring constant attendance  and though almost persuaded that nothing n    could be done for lydia  her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost n    importance  and till he entered the room her impatience was severe  mr  n    and mrs  gardiner had hurried back in alarm  supposing by the servant s n    account that their niece was taken suddenly ill  but satisfying them n    instantly on that head  she eagerly communicated the cause of their n    summons  reading the two letters aloud  and dwelling on the postscript n    of the last with trembling energy --though lydia had never been a n    favourite with them  mr  and mrs  gardiner could not but be deeply n    afflicted  not lydia only  but all were concerned in it  and after the n    first exclamations of surprise and horror  mr  gardiner promised every n    assistance in his power  elizabeth  though expecting no less  thanked n    him with tears of gratitude  and all three being actuated by one spirit  n    everything relating to their journey was speedily settled  they were to n    be off as soon as possible   but what is to be done about pemberley   n    cried mrs  gardiner   john told us mr  darcy was here when you sent for n    us  was it so   n     n     yes  and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement  n     that  is all settled   n     n     what is all settled   repeated the other  as she ran into her room to n    prepare   and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real n    truth  oh  that i knew how it was   n     n    but wishes were vain  or at least could only serve to amuse her in the n    hurry and confusion of the following hour  had elizabeth been at leisure n    to be idle  she would have remained certain that all employment was n    impossible to one so wretched as herself  but she had her share of n    business as well as her aunt  and amongst the rest there were notes to n    be written to all their friends at lambton  with false excuses for their n    sudden departure  an hour  however  saw the whole completed  and mr  n    gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn  nothing n    remained to be done but to go  and elizabeth  after all the misery of n    the morning  found herself  in a shorter space of time than she could n    have supposed  seated in the carriage  and on the road to longbourn  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n     i have been thinking it over again  elizabeth   said her uncle  as they n    drove from the town   and really  upon serious consideration  i am much n    more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the n    matter  it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should n    form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or n    friendless  and who was actually staying in his colonel s family  that i n    am strongly inclined to hope the best  could he expect that her friends n    would not step forward  could he expect to be noticed again by the n    regiment  after such an affront to colonel forster  his temptation is n    not adequate to the risk   n     n     do you really think so   cried elizabeth  brightening up for a moment  n     n     upon my word   said mrs  gardiner   i begin to be of your uncle  s n    opinion  it is really too great a violation of decency  honour  and n    interest  for him to be guilty of  i cannot think so very ill of n    wickham  can you yourself  lizzy  so wholly give him up  as to believe n    him capable of it   n     n     not  perhaps  of neglecting his own interest  but of every other n    neglect i can believe him capable  if  indeed  it should be so  but i n    dare not hope it  why should they not go on to scotland if that had been n    the case   n     n     in the first place   replied mr  gardiner   there is no absolute proof n    that they are not gone to scotland   n     n     oh  but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such n    a presumption  and  besides  no traces of them were to be found on the n    barnet road   n     n     well  then--supposing them to be in london  they may be there  though n    for the purpose of concealment  for no more exceptional purpose  it is n    not likely that money should be very abundant on either side  and it n    might strike them that they could be more economically  though less n    expeditiously  married in london than in scotland   n     n     but why all this secrecy  why any fear of detection  why must their n    marriage be private  oh  no  no--this is not likely  his most particular n    friend  you see by jane s account  was persuaded of his never intending n    to marry her  wickham will never marry a woman without some money  he n    cannot afford it  and what claims has lydia--what attraction has she n    beyond youth  health  and good humour that could make him  for her sake  n    forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well  as to what n    restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a n    dishonourable elopement with her  i am not able to judge  for i know n    nothing of the effects that such a step might produce  but as to your n    other objection  i am afraid it will hardly hold good  lydia has n    no brothers to step forward  and he might imagine  from my father s n    behaviour  from his indolence and the little attention he has ever n    seemed to give to what was going forward in his family  that  he  would n    do as little  and think as little about it  as any father could do  in n    such a matter   n     n     but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him n    as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage   n     n     it does seem  and it is most shocking indeed   replied elizabeth  with n    tears in her eyes   that a sister  s sense of decency and virtue in such n    a point should admit of doubt  but  really  i know not what to say  n    perhaps i am not doing her justice  but she is very young  she has never n    been taught to think on serious subjects  and for the last half-year  n    nay  for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement n    and vanity  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle n    and frivolous manner  and to adopt any opinions that came in her way  n    since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton  nothing but love  n    flirtation  and officers have been in her head  she has been doing n    everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject  to give n    greater--what shall i call it  susceptibility to her feelings  which are n    naturally lively enough  and we all know that wickham has every charm of n    person and address that can captivate a woman   n     n     but you see that jane   said her aunt   does not think so very ill of n    wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt   n     n     of whom does jane ever think ill  and who is there  whatever might be n    their former conduct  that she would think capable of such an attempt  n    till it were proved against them  but jane knows  as well as i do  what n    wickham really is  we both know that he has been profligate in every n    sense of the word  that he has neither integrity nor honour  that he is n    as false and deceitful as he is insinuating   n     n     and do you really know all this   cried mrs  gardiner  whose curiosity n    as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive  n     n     i do indeed   replied elizabeth  colouring   i told you  the other day  n    of his infamous behaviour to mr  darcy  and you yourself  when last at n    longbourn  heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved n    with such forbearance and liberality towards him  and there are other n    circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to n    relate  but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless  from n    what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud  n    reserved  disagreeable girl  yet he knew to the contrary himself  he n    must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found n    her   n     n     but does lydia know nothing of this  can she be ignorant of what you n    and jane seem so well to understand   n     n     oh  yes --that  that is the worst of all  till i was in kent  and saw n    so much both of mr  darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam  i was n    ignorant of the truth myself  and when i returned home  the ----shire n    was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time  as that was the n    case  neither jane  to whom i related the whole  nor i  thought it n    necessary to make our knowledge public  for of what use could n    it apparently be to any one  that the good opinion which all the n    neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown  and even when it was n    settled that lydia should go with mrs  forster  the necessity of opening n    her eyes to his character never occurred to me  that  she  could be n    in any danger from the deception never entered my head  that such a n    consequence as  this  could ensue  you may easily believe  was far n    enough from my thoughts   n     n     when they all removed to brighton  therefore  you had no reason  i n    suppose  to believe them fond of each other   n     n     not the slightest  i can remember no symptom of affection on either n    side  and had anything of the kind been perceptible  you must be aware n    that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away  when first n    he entered the corps  she was ready enough to admire him  but so we all n    were  every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for n    the first two months  but he never distinguished  her  by any particular n    attention  and  consequently  after a moderate period of extravagant and n    wild admiration  her fancy for him gave way  and others of the regiment  n    who treated her with more distinction  again became her favourites   n     n                                        n     n    it may be easily believed  that however little of novelty could be added n    to their fears  hopes  and conjectures  on this interesting subject  by n    its repeated discussion  no other could detain them from it long  during n    the whole of the journey  from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent  n    fixed there by the keenest of all anguish  self-reproach  she could find n    no interval of ease or forgetfulness  n     n    they travelled as expeditiously as possible  and  sleeping one night n    on the road  reached longbourn by dinner time the next day  it was a n    comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied n    by long expectations  n     n    the little gardiners  attracted by the sight of a chaise  were standing n    on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock  and  when the n    carriage drove up to the door  the joyful surprise that lighted up their n    faces  and displayed itself over their whole bodies  in a variety of n    capers and frisks  was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome  n     n    elizabeth jumped out  and  after giving each of them a hasty kiss  n    hurried into the vestibule  where jane  who came running down from her n    mother s apartment  immediately met her  n     n    elizabeth  as she affectionately embraced her  whilst tears filled the n    eyes of both  lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been n    heard of the fugitives  n     n     not yet   replied jane   but now that my dear uncle is come  i hope n    everything will be well   n     n     is my father in town   n     n     yes  he went on tuesday  as i wrote you word   n     n     and have you heard from him often   n     n     we have heard only twice  he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say n    that he had arrived in safety  and to give me his directions  which i n    particularly begged him to do  he merely added that he should not write n    again till he had something of importance to mention   n     n     and my mother--how is she  how are you all   n     n     my mother is tolerably well  i trust  though her spirits are greatly n    shaken  she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you n    all  she does not yet leave her dressing-room  mary and kitty  thank n    heaven  are quite well   n     n     but you--how are you   cried elizabeth   you look pale  how much you n    must have gone through   n     n    her sister  however  assured her of her being perfectly well  and their n    conversation  which had been passing while mr  and mrs  gardiner were n    engaged with their children  was now put an end to by the approach n    of the whole party  jane ran to her uncle and aunt  and welcomed and n    thanked them both  with alternate smiles and tears  n     n    when they were all in the drawing-room  the questions which elizabeth n    had already asked were of course repeated by the others  and they soon n    found that jane had no intelligence to give  the sanguine hope of n    good  however  which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet n    deserted her  she still expected that it would all end well  and that n    every morning would bring some letter  either from lydia or her father  n    to explain their proceedings  and  perhaps  announce their marriage  n     n    mrs  bennet  to whose apartment they all repaired  after a few minutes  n    conversation together  received them exactly as might be expected  with n    tears and lamentations of regret  invectives against the villainous n    conduct of wickham  and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage  n    blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the n    errors of her daughter must principally be owing  n     n     if i had been able   said she   to carry my point in going to brighton  n    with all my family   this  would not have happened  but poor dear lydia n    had nobody to take care of her  why did the forsters ever let her go out n    of their sight  i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their n    side  for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been n    well looked after  i always thought they were very unfit to have the n    charge of her  but i was overruled  as i always am  poor dear child  n    and now here s mr  bennet gone away  and i know he will fight wickham  n    wherever he meets him and then he will be killed  and what is to become n    of us all  the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his n    grave  and if you are not kind to us  brother  i do not know what we n    shall do   n     n    they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas  and mr  gardiner  after n    general assurances of his affection for her and all her family  told her n    that he meant to be in london the very next day  and would assist mr  n    bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia  n     n     do not give way to useless alarm   added he   though it is right to be n    prepared for the worst  there is no occasion to look on it as certain  n    it is not quite a week since they left brighton  in a few days more we n    may gain some news of them  and till we know that they are not married  n    and have no design of marrying  do not let us give the matter over as n    lost  as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother  and make n    him come home with me to gracechurch street  and then we may consult n    together as to what is to be done   n     n     oh  my dear brother   replied mrs  bennet   that is exactly what i n    could most wish for  and now do  when you get to town  find them out  n    wherever they may be  and if they are not married already   make  them n    marry  and as for wedding clothes  do not let them wait for that  but n    tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them  n    after they are married  and  above all  keep mr  bennet from fighting  n    tell him what a dreadful state i am in  that i am frighted out of my n    wits--and have such tremblings  such flutterings  all over me--such n    spasms in my side and pains in my head  and such beatings at heart  that n    i can get no rest by night nor by day  and tell my dear lydia not to n    give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me  for she does n    not know which are the best warehouses  oh  brother  how kind you are  i n    know you will contrive it all   n     n    but mr  gardiner  though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours n    in the cause  could not avoid recommending moderation to her  as well n    in her hopes as her fear  and after talking with her in this manner till n    dinner was on the table  they all left her to vent all her feelings on n    the housekeeper  who attended in the absence of her daughters  n     n    though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real n    occasion for such a seclusion from the family  they did not attempt to n    oppose it  for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her n    tongue before the servants  while they waited at table  and judged it n    better that  one  only of the household  and the one whom they could n    most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the n    subject  n     n    in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty  who had been n    too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance n    before  one came from her books  and the other from her toilette  the n    faces of both  however  were tolerably calm  and no change was visible n    in either  except that the loss of her favourite sister  or the anger n    which she had herself incurred in this business  had given more of n    fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty  as for mary  she was n    mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth  with a countenance n    of grave reflection  soon after they were seated at table  n     n     this is a most unfortunate affair  and will probably be much talked of  n    but we must stem the tide of malice  and pour into the wounded bosoms of n    each other the balm of sisterly consolation   n     n    then  perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying  she added  n     unhappy as the event must be for lydia  we may draw from it this useful n    lesson  that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable  that one n    false step involves her in endless ruin  that her reputation is no less n    brittle than it is beautiful  and that she cannot be too much guarded in n    her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex   n     n    elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement  but was too much oppressed n    to make any reply  mary  however  continued to console herself with such n    kind of moral extractions from the evil before them  n     n    in the afternoon  the two elder miss bennets were able to be for n    half-an-hour by themselves  and elizabeth instantly availed herself of n    the opportunity of making any inquiries  which jane was equally eager to n    satisfy  after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel n    of this event  which elizabeth considered as all but certain  and miss n    bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible  the former continued n    the subject  by saying   but tell me all and everything about it which n    i have not already heard  give me further particulars  what did colonel n    forster say  had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement n    took place  they must have seen them together for ever   n     n     colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality  n    especially on lydia s side  but nothing to give him any alarm  i am so n    grieved for him  his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost  he n     was  coming to us  in order to assure us of his concern  before he had n    any idea of their not being gone to scotland  when that apprehension n    first got abroad  it hastened his journey   n     n     and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry  did he know of n    their intending to go off  had colonel forster seen denny himself   n     n     yes  but  when questioned by  him   denny denied knowing anything of n    their plans  and would not give his real opinion about it  he did not n    repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from  that   i am n    inclined to hope  he might have been misunderstood before   n     n     and till colonel forster came himself  not one of you entertained a n    doubt  i suppose  of their being really married   n     n     how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains  i felt n    a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him n    in marriage  because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite n    right  my father and mother knew nothing of that  they only felt how n    imprudent a match it must be  kitty then owned  with a very natural n    triumph on knowing more than the rest of us  that in lydia s last letter n    she had prepared her for such a step  she had known  it seems  of their n    being in love with each other  many weeks   n     n     but not before they went to brighton   n     n     no  i believe not   n     n     and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself  does n    he know his real character   n     n     i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly n    did  he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant  and since this sad n    affair has taken place  it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt  n    but i hope this may be false   n     n     oh  jane  had we been less secret  had we told what we knew of him  n    this could not have happened   n     n     perhaps it would have been better   replied her sister   but to expose n    the former faults of any person without knowing what their present n    feelings were  seemed unjustifiable  we acted with the best intentions   n     n     could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia  s note to his n    wife   n     n     he brought it with him for us to see   n     n    jane then took it from her pocket-book  and gave it to elizabeth  these n    were the contents  n     n     my dear harriet  n     n     you will laugh when you know where i am gone  and i cannot help n    laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning  as soon as i am n    missed  i am going to gretna green  and if you cannot guess with who  n    i shall think you a simpleton  for there is but one man in the world i n    love  and he is an angel  i should never be happy without him  so think n    it no harm to be off  you need not send them word at longbourn of my n    going  if you do not like it  for it will make the surprise the greater  n    when i write to them and sign my name  lydia wickham   what a good joke n    it will be  i can hardly write for laughing  pray make my excuses to n    pratt for not keeping my engagement  and dancing with him to-night  n    tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all  and tell him i will n    dance with him at the next ball we meet  with great pleasure  i shall n    send for my clothes when i get to longbourn  but i wish you would tell n    sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are n    packed up  good-bye  give my love to colonel forster  i hope you will n    drink to our good journey  n     n     your affectionate friend  n     n     lydia bennet   n     n     oh  thoughtless  thoughtless lydia   cried elizabeth when she had n    finished it   what a letter is this  to be written at such a moment  n    but at least it shows that  she  was serious on the subject of their n    journey  whatever he might afterwards persuade her to  it was not on her n    side a  scheme  of infamy  my poor father  how he must have felt it   n     n     i never saw anyone so shocked  he could not speak a word for full ten n    minutes  my mother was taken ill immediately  and the whole house in n    such confusion   n     n     oh  jane   cried elizabeth   was there a servant belonging to it who n    did not know the whole story before the end of the day   n     n     i do not know  i hope there was  but to be guarded at such a time is n    very difficult  my mother was in hysterics  and though i endeavoured to n    give her every assistance in my power  i am afraid i did not do so n    much as i might have done  but the horror of what might possibly happen n    almost took from me my faculties   n     n     your attendance upon her has been too much for you  you do not look n    well  oh that i had been with you  you have had every care and anxiety n    upon yourself alone   n     n     mary and kitty have been very kind  and would have shared in every n    fatigue  i am sure  but i did not think it right for either of them  n    kitty is slight and delicate  and mary studies so much  that her hours n    of repose should not be broken in on  my aunt phillips came to longbourn n    on tuesday  after my father went away  and was so good as to stay till n    thursday with me  she was of great use and comfort to us all  and n    lady lucas has been very kind  she walked here on wednesday morning to n    condole with us  and offered her services  or any of her daughters   if n    they should be of use to us   n     n     she had better have stayed at home   cried elizabeth   perhaps she n     meant  well  but  under such a misfortune as this  one cannot see n    too little of one s neighbours  assistance is impossible  condolence n    insufferable  let them triumph over us at a distance  and be satisfied   n     n    she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had n    intended to pursue  while in town  for the recovery of his daughter  n     n     he meant i believe   replied jane   to go to epsom  the place where n    they last changed horses  see the postilions and try if anything could n    be made out from them  his principal object must be to discover the n    number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham  it had come n    with a fare from london  and as he thought that the circumstance of a n    gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might n    be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham  if he could anyhow n    discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare  he n    determined to make inquiries there  and hoped it might not be impossible n    to find out the stand and number of the coach  i do not know of any n    other designs that he had formed  but he was in such a hurry to be gone  n    and his spirits so greatly discomposed  that i had difficulty in finding n    out even so much as this   n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr  bennet the next n    morning  but the post came in without bringing a single line from him  n    his family knew him to be  on all common occasions  a most negligent and n    dilatory correspondent  but at such a time they had hoped for exertion  n    they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to n    send  but even of  that  they would have been glad to be certain  mr  n    gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off  n     n    when he was gone  they were certain at least of receiving constant n    information of what was going on  and their uncle promised  at parting  n    to prevail on mr  bennet to return to longbourn  as soon as he could  n    to the great consolation of his sister  who considered it as the only n    security for her husband s not being killed in a duel  n     n    mrs  gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few n    days longer  as the former thought her presence might be serviceable n    to her nieces  she shared in their attendance on mrs  bennet  and was a n    great comfort to them in their hours of freedom  their other aunt also n    visited them frequently  and always  as she said  with the design of n    cheering and heartening them up--though  as she never came without n    reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity  n    she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found n    them  n     n    all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who  but three months n    before  had been almost an angel of light  he was declared to be in debt n    to every tradesman in the place  and his intrigues  all honoured with n    the title of seduction  had been extended into every tradesman s family  n    everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world  n    and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the n    appearance of his goodness  elizabeth  though she did not credit above n    half of what was said  believed enough to make her former assurance of n    her sister s ruin more certain  and even jane  who believed still less n    of it  became almost hopeless  more especially as the time was now come n    when  if they had gone to scotland  which she had never before entirely n    despaired of  they must in all probability have gained some news of n    them  n     n    mr  gardiner left longbourn on sunday  on tuesday his wife received a n    letter from him  it told them that  on his arrival  he had immediately n    found out his brother  and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street  n    that mr  bennet had been to epsom and clapham  before his arrival  n    but without gaining any satisfactory information  and that he was now n    determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town  as mr  bennet n    thought it possible they might have gone to one of them  on their first n    coming to london  before they procured lodgings  mr  gardiner himself n    did not expect any success from this measure  but as his brother was n    eager in it  he meant to assist him in pursuing it  he added that mr  n    bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised n    to write again very soon  there was also a postscript to this effect  n     n     i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out  if n    possible  from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment  n    whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to n    know in what part of town he has now concealed himself  if there were n    anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a n    clue as that  it might be of essential consequence  at present we have n    nothing to guide us  colonel forster will  i dare say  do everything in n    his power to satisfy us on this head  but  on second thoughts  perhaps  n    lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living  better than any n    other person   n     n    elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her n    authority proceeded  but it was not in her power to give any information n    of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved  she had never n    heard of his having had any relations  except a father and mother  both n    of whom had been dead many years  it was possible  however  that some of n    his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information  n    and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it  the application n    was a something to look forward to  n     n    every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety  but the most anxious n    part of each was when the post was expected  the arrival of letters n    was the grand object of every morning s impatience  through letters  n    whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated  and every n    succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance  n     n    but before they heard again from mr  gardiner  a letter arrived for n    their father  from a different quarter  from mr  collins  which  as jane n    had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence  n    she accordingly read  and elizabeth  who knew what curiosities his n    letters always were  looked over her  and read it likewise  it was as n    follows  n     n     my dear sir  n     n     i feel myself called upon  by our relationship  and my situation n    in life  to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now n    suffering under  of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from n    hertfordshire  be assured  my dear sir  that mrs  collins and myself n    sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family  in n    your present distress  which must be of the bitterest kind  because n    proceeding from a cause which no time can remove  no arguments shall be n    wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that n    may comfort you  under a circumstance that must be of all others the n    most afflicting to a parent s mind  the death of your daughter would n    have been a blessing in comparison of this  and it is the more to n    be lamented  because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte n    informs me  that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has n    proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence  though  at the same time  n    for the consolation of yourself and mrs  bennet  i am inclined to think n    that her own disposition must be naturally bad  or she could not be n    guilty of such an enormity  at so early an age  howsoever that may be  n    you are grievously to be pitied  in which opinion i am not only joined n    by mrs  collins  but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter  to n    whom i have related the affair  they agree with me in apprehending that n    this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of n    all the others  for who  as lady catherine herself condescendingly says  n    will connect themselves with such a family  and this consideration leads n    me moreover to reflect  with augmented satisfaction  on a certain event n    of last november  for had it been otherwise  i must have been involved n    in all your sorrow and disgrace  let me then advise you  dear sir  to n    console yourself as much as possible  to throw off your unworthy child n    from your affection for ever  and leave her to reap the fruits of her n    own heinous offense  n     n     i am  dear sir  etc   etc   n     n    mr  gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from n    colonel forster  and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send  n    it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he n    kept up any connection  and it was certain that he had no near one n    living  his former acquaintances had been numerous  but since he n    had been in the militia  it did not appear that he was on terms of n    particular friendship with any of them  there was no one  therefore  n    who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him  and in the n    wretched state of his own finances  there was a very powerful motive for n    secrecy  in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations  for n    it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a n    very considerable amount  colonel forster believed that more than a n    thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton  n    he owed a good deal in town  but his debts of honour were still more n    formidable  mr  gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars n    from the longbourn family  jane heard them with horror   a gamester   n    she cried   this is wholly unexpected  i had not an idea of it   n     n    mr  gardiner added in his letter  that they might expect to see their n    father at home on the following day  which was saturday  rendered n    spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours  he had yielded n    to his brother-in-law s entreaty that he would return to his family  and n    leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable n    for continuing their pursuit  when mrs  bennet was told of this  she did n    not express so much satisfaction as her children expected  considering n    what her anxiety for his life had been before  n     n     what  is he coming home  and without poor lydia   she cried   sure he n    will not leave london before he has found them  who is to fight wickham  n    and make him marry her  if he comes away   n     n    as mrs  gardiner began to wish to be at home  it was settled that she n    and the children should go to london  at the same time that mr  bennet n    came from it  the coach  therefore  took them the first stage of their n    journey  and brought its master back to longbourn  n     n    mrs  gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her n    derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world  his n    name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece  and n    the kind of half-expectation which mrs  gardiner had formed  of their n    being followed by a letter from him  had ended in nothing  elizabeth had n    received none since her return that could come from pemberley  n     n    the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for n    the lowness of her spirits unnecessary  nothing  therefore  could be n    fairly conjectured from  that   though elizabeth  who was by this time n    tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings  was perfectly aware n    that  had she known nothing of darcy  she could have borne the dread of n    lydia s infamy somewhat better  it would have spared her  she thought  n    one sleepless night out of two  n     n    when mr  bennet arrived  he had all the appearance of his usual n    philosophic composure  he said as little as he had ever been in the n    habit of saying  made no mention of the business that had taken him n    away  and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of n    it  n     n    it was not till the afternoon  when he had joined them at tea  that n    elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject  and then  on her briefly n    expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured  he replied   say n    nothing of that  who should suffer but myself  it has been my own doing  n    and i ought to feel it   n     n     you must not be too severe upon yourself   replied elizabeth  n     n     you may well warn me against such an evil  human nature is so prone n    to fall into it  no  lizzy  let me once in my life feel how much i have n    been to blame  i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression  n    it will pass away soon enough   n     n     do you suppose them to be in london   n     n     yes  where else can they be so well concealed   n     n     and lydia used to want to go to london   added kitty  n     n     she is happy then   said her father drily   and her residence there n    will probably be of some duration   n     n    then after a short silence he continued  n     n     lizzy  i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me n    last may  which  considering the event  shows some greatness of mind   n     n    they were interrupted by miss bennet  who came to fetch her mother s n    tea  n     n     this is a parade   he cried   which does one good  it gives such an n    elegance to misfortune  another day i will do the same  i will sit in my n    library  in my nightcap and powdering gown  and give as much trouble as n    i can  or  perhaps  i may defer it till kitty runs away   n     n     i am not going to run away  papa   said kitty fretfully   if i should n    ever go to brighton  i would behave better than lydia   n     n      you  go to brighton  i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne n    for fifty pounds  no  kitty  i have at last learnt to be cautious  and n    you will feel the effects of it  no officer is ever to enter into n    my house again  nor even to pass through the village  balls will be n    absolutely prohibited  unless you stand up with one of your sisters  n    and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have n    spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner   n     n    kitty  who took all these threats in a serious light  began to cry  n     n     well  well   said he   do not make yourself unhappy  if you are a good n    girl for the next ten years  i will take you to a review at the end of n    them   n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n    two days after mr  bennet s return  as jane and elizabeth were walking n    together in the shrubbery behind the house  they saw the housekeeper n    coming towards them  and  concluding that she came to call them to their n    mother  went forward to meet her  but  instead of the expected summons  n    when they approached her  she said to miss bennet   i beg your pardon  n    madam  for interrupting you  but i was in hopes you might have got some n    good news from town  so i took the liberty of coming to ask   n     n     what do you mean  hill  we have heard nothing from town   n     n     dear madam   cried mrs  hill  in great astonishment   don  t you know n    there is an express come for master from mr  gardiner  he has been here n    this half-hour  and master has had a letter   n     n    away ran the girls  too eager to get in to have time for speech  they n    ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room  from thence to the n    library  their father was in neither  and they were on the point of n    seeking him up stairs with their mother  when they were met by the n    butler  who said  n     n     if you are looking for my master  ma  am  he is walking towards the n    little copse   n     n    upon this information  they instantly passed through the hall once n    more  and ran across the lawn after their father  who was deliberately n    pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock  n     n    jane  who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as n    elizabeth  soon lagged behind  while her sister  panting for breath  n    came up with him  and eagerly cried out  n     n     oh  papa  what news--what news  have you heard from my uncle   n     n     yes i have had a letter from him by express   n     n     well  and what news does it bring--good or bad   n     n     what is there of good to be expected   said he  taking the letter from n    his pocket   but perhaps you would like to read it   n     n    elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand  jane now came up  n     n     read it aloud   said their father   for i hardly know myself what it is n    about   n     n     gracechurch street  monday  august    n     n     my dear brother  n     n     at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece  and such as  n    upon the whole  i hope it will give you satisfaction  soon after you n    left me on saturday  i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of n    london they were  the particulars i reserve till we meet  it is enough n    to know they are discovered  i have seen them both--  n     n     then it is as i always hoped   cried jane   they are married   n     n    elizabeth read on  n     n     i have seen them both  they are not married  nor can i find there n    was any intention of being so  but if you are willing to perform the n    engagements which i have ventured to make on your side  i hope it will n    not be long before they are  all that is required of you is  to assure n    to your daughter  by settlement  her equal share of the five thousand n    pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and n    my sister  and  moreover  to enter into an engagement of allowing her  n    during your life  one hundred pounds per annum  these are conditions n    which  considering everything  i had no hesitation in complying with  n    as far as i thought myself privileged  for you  i shall send this by n    express  that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer  you n    will easily comprehend  from these particulars  that mr  wickham s n    circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be  n    the world has been deceived in that respect  and i am happy to say there n    will be some little money  even when all his debts are discharged  to n    settle on my niece  in addition to her own fortune  if  as i conclude n    will be the case  you send me full powers to act in your name throughout n    the whole of this business  i will immediately give directions to n    haggerston for preparing a proper settlement  there will not be the n    smallest occasion for your coming to town again  therefore stay quiet at n    longbourn  and depend on my diligence and care  send back your answer as n    fast as you can  and be careful to write explicitly  we have judged it n    best that my niece should be married from this house  of which i hope n    you will approve  she comes to us to-day  i shall write again as soon as n    anything more is determined on  yours  etc   n     n     edw  gardiner   n     n     is it possible   cried elizabeth  when she had finished   can it be n    possible that he will marry her   n     n     wickham is not so undeserving  then  as we thought him   said her n    sister   my dear father  i congratulate you   n     n     and have you answered the letter   cried elizabeth  n     n     no  but it must be done soon   n     n    most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he n    wrote  n     n     oh  my dear father   she cried   come back and write immediately  n    consider how important every moment is in such a case   n     n     let me write for you   said jane   if you dislike the trouble n    yourself   n     n     i dislike it very much   he replied   but it must be done   n     n    and so saying  he turned back with them  and walked towards the house  n     n     and may i ask--  said elizabeth   but the terms  i suppose  must be n    complied with   n     n     complied with  i am only ashamed of his asking so little   n     n     and they  must  marry  yet he is  such  a man   n     n     yes  yes  they must marry  there is nothing else to be done  but there n    are two things that i want very much to know  one is  how much money n    your uncle has laid down to bring it about  and the other  how am i ever n    to pay him   n     n     money  my uncle   cried jane   what do you mean  sir   n     n     i mean  that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a n    temptation as one hundred a year during my life  and fifty after i am n    gone   n     n     that is very true   said elizabeth   though it had not occurred to me n    before  his debts to be discharged  and something still to remain  oh  n    it must be my uncle s doings  generous  good man  i am afraid he has n    distressed himself  a small sum could not do all this   n     n     no   said her father   wickham  s a fool if he takes her with a farthing n    less than ten thousand pounds  i should be sorry to think so ill of him  n    in the very beginning of our relationship   n     n     ten thousand pounds  heaven forbid  how is half such a sum to be n    repaid   n     n    mr  bennet made no answer  and each of them  deep in thought  continued n    silent till they reached the house  their father then went on to the n    library to write  and the girls walked into the breakfast-room  n     n     and they are really to be married   cried elizabeth  as soon as they n    were by themselves   how strange this is  and for  this  we are to be n    thankful  that they should marry  small as is their chance of happiness  n    and wretched as is his character  we are forced to rejoice  oh  lydia   n     n     i comfort myself with thinking   replied jane   that he certainly would n    not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her  though our kind n    uncle has done something towards clearing him  i cannot believe that ten n    thousand pounds  or anything like it  has been advanced  he has children n    of his own  and may have more  how could he spare half ten thousand n    pounds   n     n     if he were ever able to learn what wickham  s debts have been   said n    elizabeth   and how much is settled on his side on our sister  we shall n    exactly know what mr  gardiner has done for them  because wickham has n    not sixpence of his own  the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never n    be requited  their taking her home  and affording her their personal n    protection and countenance  is such a sacrifice to her advantage as n    years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge  by this time she is n    actually with them  if such goodness does not make her miserable now  n    she will never deserve to be happy  what a meeting for her  when she n    first sees my aunt   n     n     we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side   said n    jane   i hope and trust they will yet be happy  his consenting to n    marry her is a proof  i will believe  that he is come to a right way of n    thinking  their mutual affection will steady them  and i flatter myself n    they will settle so quietly  and live in so rational a manner  as may in n    time make their past imprudence forgotten   n     n     their conduct has been such   replied elizabeth   as neither you  nor n    i  nor anybody can ever forget  it is useless to talk of it   n     n    it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood n    perfectly ignorant of what had happened  they went to the library  n    therefore  and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make n    it known to her  he was writing and  without raising his head  coolly n    replied  n     n     just as you please   n     n     may we take my uncle  s letter to read to her   n     n     take whatever you like  and get away   n     n    elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table  and they went up stairs n    together  mary and kitty were both with mrs  bennet  one communication n    would  therefore  do for all  after a slight preparation for good news  n    the letter was read aloud  mrs  bennet could hardly contain herself  as n    soon as jane had read mr  gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon n    married  her joy burst forth  and every following sentence added to its n    exuberance  she was now in an irritation as violent from delight  as she n    had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation  to know that her daughter n    would be married was enough  she was disturbed by no fear for her n    felicity  nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct  n     n     my dear  dear lydia   she cried   this is delightful indeed  she will n    be married  i shall see her again  she will be married at sixteen  n    my good  kind brother  i knew how it would be  i knew he would manage n    everything  how i long to see her  and to see dear wickham too  but the n    clothes  the wedding clothes  i will write to my sister gardiner about n    them directly  lizzy  my dear  run down to your father  and ask him n    how much he will give her  stay  stay  i will go myself  ring the bell  n    kitty  for hill  i will put on my things in a moment  my dear  dear n    lydia  how merry we shall be together when we meet   n     n    her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of n    these transports  by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr  n    gardiner s behaviour laid them all under  n     n     for we must attribute this happy conclusion   she added   in a great n    measure to his kindness  we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to n    assist mr  wickham with money   n     n     well   cried her mother   it is all very right  who should do it but n    her own uncle  if he had not had a family of his own  i and my children n    must have had all his money  you know  and it is the first time we have n    ever had anything from him  except a few presents  well  i am so happy  n    in a short time i shall have a daughter married  mrs  wickham  how well n    it sounds  and she was only sixteen last june  my dear jane  i am in n    such a flutter  that i am sure i can t write  so i will dictate  and n    you write for me  we will settle with your father about the money n    afterwards  but the things should be ordered immediately   n     n    she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico  muslin  and n    cambric  and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders  had n    not jane  though with some difficulty  persuaded her to wait till her n    father was at leisure to be consulted  one day s delay  she observed  n    would be of small importance  and her mother was too happy to be quite n    so obstinate as usual  other schemes  too  came into her head  n     n     i will go to meryton   said she   as soon as i am dressed  and tell the n    good  good news to my sister philips  and as i come back  i can call n    on lady lucas and mrs  long  kitty  run down and order the carriage  n    an airing would do me a great deal of good  i am sure  girls  can i do n    anything for you in meryton  oh  here comes hill  my dear hill  have you n    heard the good news  miss lydia is going to be married  and you shall n    all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding   n     n    mrs  hill began instantly to express her joy  elizabeth received her n    congratulations amongst the rest  and then  sick of this folly  took n    refuge in her own room  that she might think with freedom  n     n    poor lydia s situation must  at best  be bad enough  but that it was n    no worse  she had need to be thankful  she felt it so  and though  in n    looking forward  neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could n    be justly expected for her sister  in looking back to what they had n    feared  only two hours ago  she felt all the advantages of what they had n    gained  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    mr  bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that  n    instead of spending his whole income  he had laid by an annual sum for n    the better provision of his children  and of his wife  if she survived n    him  he now wished it more than ever  had he done his duty in that n    respect  lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever n    of honour or credit could now be purchased for her  the satisfaction of n    prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be n    her husband might then have rested in its proper place  n     n    he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone n    should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law  and he n    was determined  if possible  to find out the extent of his assistance  n    and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could  n     n    when first mr  bennet had married  economy was held to be perfectly n    useless  for  of course  they were to have a son  the son was to join n    in cutting off the entail  as soon as he should be of age  and the widow n    and younger children would by that means be provided for  five daughters n    successively entered the world  but yet the son was to come  and mrs  n    bennet  for many years after lydia s birth  had been certain that he n    would  this event had at last been despaired of  but it was then n    too late to be saving  mrs  bennet had no turn for economy  and her n    husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their n    income  n     n    five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs  bennet and n    the children  but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the n    latter depended on the will of the parents  this was one point  with n    regard to lydia  at least  which was now to be settled  and mr  bennet n    could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him  in n    terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother  n    though expressed most concisely  he then delivered on paper his perfect n    approbation of all that was done  and his willingness to fulfil the n    engagements that had been made for him  he had never before supposed n    that  could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter  it would n    be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present n    arrangement  he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the n    hundred that was to be paid them  for  what with her board and pocket n    allowance  and the continual presents in money which passed to her n    through her mother s hands  lydia s expenses had been very little within n    that sum  n     n    that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side  too  was n    another very welcome surprise  for his wish at present was to have as n    little trouble in the business as possible  when the first transports n    of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over  he n    naturally returned to all his former indolence  his letter was soon n    dispatched  for  though dilatory in undertaking business  he was quick n    in its execution  he begged to know further particulars of what he n    was indebted to his brother  but was too angry with lydia to send any n    message to her  n     n    the good news spread quickly through the house  and with proportionate n    speed through the neighbourhood  it was borne in the latter with decent n    philosophy  to be sure  it would have been more for the advantage n    of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town  or  as the n    happiest alternative  been secluded from the world  in some distant n    farmhouse  but there was much to be talked of in marrying her  and the n    good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from n    all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit n    in this change of circumstances  because with such an husband her misery n    was considered certain  n     n    it was a fortnight since mrs  bennet had been downstairs  but on this n    happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table  and in n    spirits oppressively high  no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her n    triumph  the marriage of a daughter  which had been the first object n    of her wishes since jane was sixteen  was now on the point of n    accomplishment  and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those n    attendants of elegant nuptials  fine muslins  new carriages  and n    servants  she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a n    proper situation for her daughter  and  without knowing or considering n    what their income might be  rejected many as deficient in size and n    importance  n     n     haye park might do   said she   if the gouldings could quit it--or the n    great house at stoke  if the drawing-room were larger  but ashworth is n    too far off  i could not bear to have her ten miles from me  and as for n    pulvis lodge  the attics are dreadful   n     n    her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the n    servants remained  but when they had withdrawn  he said to her   mrs  n    bennet  before you take any or all of these houses for your son and n    daughter  let us come to a right understanding  into  one  house in this n    neighbourhood they shall never have admittance  i will not encourage the n    impudence of either  by receiving them at longbourn   n     n    a long dispute followed this declaration  but mr  bennet was firm  it n    soon led to another  and mrs  bennet found  with amazement and horror  n    that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his n    daughter  he protested that she should receive from him no mark of n    affection whatever on the occasion  mrs  bennet could hardly comprehend n    it  that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable n    resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her n    marriage would scarcely seem valid  exceeded all she could believe n    possible  she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new n    clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials  than to any sense of n    shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they n    took place  n     n    elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had  from the distress of n    the moment  been led to make mr  darcy acquainted with their fears for n    her sister  for since her marriage would so shortly give the n    proper termination to the elopement  they might hope to conceal its n    unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the n    spot  n     n    she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means  there were n    few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended  n    but  at the same time  there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s n    frailty would have mortified her so much--not  however  from any fear n    of disadvantage from it individually to herself  for  at any rate  n    there seemed a gulf impassable between them  had lydia s marriage been n    concluded on the most honourable terms  it was not to be supposed that n    mr  darcy would connect himself with a family where  to every other n    objection  would now be added an alliance and relationship of the n    nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned  n     n    from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink  the n    wish of procuring her regard  which she had assured herself of his n    feeling in derbyshire  could not in rational expectation survive such a n    blow as this  she was humbled  she was grieved  she repented  though she n    hardly knew of what  she became jealous of his esteem  when she could no n    longer hope to be benefited by it  she wanted to hear of him  when there n    seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence  she was convinced that n    she could have been happy with him  when it was no longer likely they n    should meet  n     n    what a triumph for him  as she often thought  could he know that the n    proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago  would now n    have been most gladly and gratefully received  he was as generous  she n    doubted not  as the most generous of his sex  but while he was mortal  n    there must be a triumph  n     n    she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who  in n    disposition and talents  would most suit her  his understanding and n    temper  though unlike her own  would have answered all her wishes  it n    was an union that must have been to the advantage of both  by her ease n    and liveliness  his mind might have been softened  his manners improved  n    and from his judgement  information  and knowledge of the world  she n    must have received benefit of greater importance  n     n    but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what n    connubial felicity really was  an union of a different tendency  and n    precluding the possibility of the other  was soon to be formed in their n    family  n     n    how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence  n    she could not imagine  but how little of permanent happiness could n    belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions n    were stronger than their virtue  she could easily conjecture  n     n                                        n     n    mr  gardiner soon wrote again to his brother  to mr  bennet s n    acknowledgments he briefly replied  with assurance of his eagerness to n    promote the welfare of any of his family  and concluded with entreaties n    that the subject might never be mentioned to him again  the principal n    purport of his letter was to inform them that mr  wickham had resolved n    on quitting the militia  n     n     it was greatly my wish that he should do so   he added   as soon as n    his marriage was fixed on  and i think you will agree with me  in n    considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable  both on n    his account and my niece s  it is mr  wickham s intention to go into n    the regulars  and among his former friends  there are still some who n    are able and willing to assist him in the army  he has the promise of an n    ensigncy in general ---- s regiment  now quartered in the north  it n    is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom  he n    promises fairly  and i hope among different people  where they may each n    have a character to preserve  they will both be more prudent  i have n    written to colonel forster  to inform him of our present arrangements  n    and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr  wickham n    in and near brighton  with assurances of speedy payment  for which i n    have pledged myself  and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying n    similar assurances to his creditors in meryton  of whom i shall subjoin n    a list according to his information  he has given in all his debts  i n    hope at least he has not deceived us  haggerston has our directions  n    and all will be completed in a week  they will then join his regiment  n    unless they are first invited to longbourn  and i understand from mrs  n    gardiner  that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she n    leaves the south  she is well  and begs to be dutifully remembered to n    you and her mother --yours  etc   n     n     e  gardiner   n     n    mr  bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal n    from the ----shire as clearly as mr  gardiner could do  but mrs  bennet n    was not so well pleased with it  lydia s being settled in the north  n    just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company  n    for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in n    hertfordshire  was a severe disappointment  and  besides  it was such a n    pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted n    with everybody  and had so many favourites  n     n     she is so fond of mrs  forster   said she   it will be quite shocking n    to send her away  and there are several of the young men  too  that she n    likes very much  the officers may not be so pleasant in general ---- s n    regiment   n     n    his daughter s request  for such it might be considered  of being n    admitted into her family again before she set off for the north  n    received at first an absolute negative  but jane and elizabeth  n    who agreed in wishing  for the sake of their sister s feelings and n    consequence  that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents  n    urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly  to receive her n    and her husband at longbourn  as soon as they were married  that he was n    prevailed on to think as they thought  and act as they wished  and their n    mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show n    her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the n    north  when mr  bennet wrote again to his brother  therefore  he sent n    his permission for them to come  and it was settled  that as soon as n    the ceremony was over  they should proceed to longbourn  elizabeth was n    surprised  however  that wickham should consent to such a scheme  and n    had she consulted only her own inclination  any meeting with him would n    have been the last object of her wishes  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    their sister s wedding day arrived  and jane and elizabeth felt for her n    probably more than she felt for herself  the carriage was sent to n    meet them at ----  and they were to return in it by dinner-time  their n    arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets  and jane more especially  n    who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself  had she n    been the culprit  and was wretched in the thought of what her sister n    must endure  n     n    they came  the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive n    them  smiles decked the face of mrs  bennet as the carriage drove up to n    the door  her husband looked impenetrably grave  her daughters  alarmed  n    anxious  uneasy  n     n    lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule  the door was thrown open  and n    she ran into the room  her mother stepped forwards  embraced her  and n    welcomed her with rapture  gave her hand  with an affectionate smile  n    to wickham  who followed his lady  and wished them both joy with an n    alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness  n     n    their reception from mr  bennet  to whom they then turned  was not quite n    so cordial  his countenance rather gained in austerity  and he scarcely n    opened his lips  the easy assurance of the young couple  indeed  was n    enough to provoke him  elizabeth was disgusted  and even miss bennet n    was shocked  lydia was lydia still  untamed  unabashed  wild  noisy  n    and fearless  she turned from sister to sister  demanding their n    congratulations  and when at length they all sat down  looked eagerly n    round the room  took notice of some little alteration in it  and n    observed  with a laugh  that it was a great while since she had been n    there  n     n    wickham was not at all more distressed than herself  but his manners n    were always so pleasing  that had his character and his marriage been n    exactly what they ought  his smiles and his easy address  while he n    claimed their relationship  would have delighted them all  elizabeth had n    not before believed him quite equal to such assurance  but she sat down  n    resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence n    of an impudent man  she blushed  and jane blushed  but the cheeks of the n    two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour  n     n    there was no want of discourse  the bride and her mother could neither n    of them talk fast enough  and wickham  who happened to sit near n    elizabeth  began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood  n    with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her n    replies  they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the n    world  nothing of the past was recollected with pain  and lydia led n    voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for n    the world  n     n     only think of its being three months   she cried   since i went away  n    it seems but a fortnight i declare  and yet there have been things n    enough happened in the time  good gracious  when i went away  i am sure n    i had no more idea of being married till i came back again  though i n    thought it would be very good fun if i was   n     n    her father lifted up his eyes  jane was distressed  elizabeth looked n    expressively at lydia  but she  who never heard nor saw anything of n    which she chose to be insensible  gaily continued   oh  mamma  do the n    people hereabouts know i am married to-day  i was afraid they might not  n    and we overtook william goulding in his curricle  so i was determined he n    should know it  and so i let down the side-glass next to him  and took n    off my glove  and let my hand just rest upon the window frame  so that n    he might see the ring  and then i bowed and smiled like anything   n     n    elizabeth could bear it no longer  she got up  and ran out of the room  n    and returned no more  till she heard them passing through the hall to n    the dining parlour  she then joined them soon enough to see lydia  with n    anxious parade  walk up to her mother s right hand  and hear her say n    to her eldest sister   ah  jane  i take your place now  and you must go n    lower  because i am a married woman   n     n    it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment n    from which she had been so wholly free at first  her ease and good n    spirits increased  she longed to see mrs  phillips  the lucases  and n    all their other neighbours  and to hear herself called  mrs  wickham  n    by each of them  and in the mean time  she went after dinner to show her n    ring  and boast of being married  to mrs  hill and the two housemaids  n     n     well  mamma   said she  when they were all returned to the breakfast n    room   and what do you think of my husband  is not he a charming man  i n    am sure my sisters must all envy me  i only hope they may have half n    my good luck  they must all go to brighton  that is the place to get n    husbands  what a pity it is  mamma  we did not all go   n     n     very true  and if i had my will  we should  but my dear lydia  i don  t n    at all like your going such a way off  must it be so   n     n     oh  lord  yes --there is nothing in that  i shall like it of all n    things  you and papa  and my sisters  must come down and see us  we n    shall be at newcastle all the winter  and i dare say there will be some n    balls  and i will take care to get good partners for them all   n     n     i should like it beyond anything   said her mother  n     n     and then when you go away  you may leave one or two of my sisters n    behind you  and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the n    winter is over   n     n     i thank you for my share of the favour   said elizabeth   but i do not n    particularly like your way of getting husbands   n     n    their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them  mr  wickham n    had received his commission before he left london  and he was to join n    his regiment at the end of a fortnight  n     n    no one but mrs  bennet regretted that their stay would be so short  and n    she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter  and n    having very frequent parties at home  these parties were acceptable to n    all  to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did n    think  than such as did not  n     n    wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected n    to find it  not equal to lydia s for him  she had scarcely needed her n    present observation to be satisfied  from the reason of things  that n    their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love  rather n    than by his  and she would have wondered why  without violently caring n    for her  he chose to elope with her at all  had she not felt certain n    that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances  and n    if that were the case  he was not the young man to resist an opportunity n    of having a companion  n     n    lydia was exceedingly fond of him  he was her dear wickham on every n    occasion  no one was to be put in competition with him  he did every n    thing best in the world  and she was sure he would kill more birds on n    the first of september  than any body else in the country  n     n    one morning  soon after their arrival  as she was sitting with her two n    elder sisters  she said to elizabeth  n     n     lizzy  i never gave  you  an account of my wedding  i believe  you n    were not by  when i told mamma and the others all about it  are not you n    curious to hear how it was managed   n     n     no really   replied elizabeth   i think there cannot be too little said n    on the subject   n     n     la  you are so strange  but i must tell you how it went off  we were n    married  you know  at st  clement s  because wickham s lodgings were in n    that parish  and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven n    o clock  my uncle and aunt and i were to go together  and the others n    were to meet us at the church  well  monday morning came  and i was in n    such a fuss  i was so afraid  you know  that something would happen to n    put it off  and then i should have gone quite distracted  and there was n    my aunt  all the time i was dressing  preaching and talking away just as n    if she was reading a sermon  however  i did not hear above one word in n    ten  for i was thinking  you may suppose  of my dear wickham  i longed n    to know whether he would be married in his blue coat   n     n     well  and so we breakfasted at ten as usual  i thought it would never n    be over  for  by the bye  you are to understand  that my uncle and aunt n    were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them  if you ll believe n    me  i did not once put my foot out of doors  though i was there a n    fortnight  not one party  or scheme  or anything  to be sure london was n    rather thin  but  however  the little theatre was open  well  and so n    just as the carriage came to the door  my uncle was called away upon n    business to that horrid man mr  stone  and then  you know  when once n    they get together  there is no end of it  well  i was so frightened i n    did not know what to do  for my uncle was to give me away  and if we n    were beyond the hour  we could not be married all day  but  luckily  he n    came back again in ten minutes  time  and then we all set out  however  n    i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going  the n    wedding need not be put off  for mr  darcy might have done as well   n     n     mr  darcy   repeated elizabeth  in utter amazement  n     n     oh  yes --he was to come there with wickham  you know  but gracious n    me  i quite forgot  i ought not to have said a word about it  i promised n    them so faithfully  what will wickham say  it was to be such a secret   n     n     if it was to be secret   said jane   say not another word on the n    subject  you may depend upon my seeking no further   n     n     oh  certainly   said elizabeth  though burning with curiosity   we will n    ask you no questions   n     n     thank you   said lydia   for if you did  i should certainly tell you n    all  and then wickham would be angry   n     n    on such encouragement to ask  elizabeth was forced to put it out of her n    power  by running away  n     n    but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible  or at least n    it was impossible not to try for information  mr  darcy had been at n    her sister s wedding  it was exactly a scene  and exactly among people  n    where he had apparently least to do  and least temptation to go  n    conjectures as to the meaning of it  rapid and wild  hurried into her n    brain  but she was satisfied with none  those that best pleased her  as n    placing his conduct in the noblest light  seemed most improbable  she n    could not bear such suspense  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper  n    wrote a short letter to her aunt  to request an explanation of what n    lydia had dropt  if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been n    intended  n     n     you may readily comprehend   she added   what my curiosity must be n    to know how a person unconnected with any of us  and  comparatively n    speaking  a stranger to our family  should have been amongst you at such n    a time  pray write instantly  and let me understand it--unless it is  n    for very cogent reasons  to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems n    to think necessary  and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with n    ignorance   n     n     not that i  shall   though   she added to herself  as she finished n    the letter   and my dear aunt  if you do not tell me in an honourable n    manner  i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it n    out   n     n    jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to n    elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall  elizabeth was glad n    of it --till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any n    satisfaction  she had rather be without a confidante  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as n    soon as she possibly could  she was no sooner in possession of it n    than  hurrying into the little copse  where she was least likely to n    be interrupted  she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to n    be happy  for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not n    contain a denial  n     n     gracechurch street  sept     n     n     my dear niece  n     n     i have just received your letter  and shall devote this whole morning n    to answering it  as i foresee that a  little  writing will not comprise n    what i have to tell you  i must confess myself surprised by your n    application  i did not expect it from  you   don t think me angry  n    however  for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such n    inquiries to be necessary on  your  side  if you do not choose to n    understand me  forgive my impertinence  your uncle is as much surprised n    as i am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned n    would have allowed him to act as he has done  but if you are really n    innocent and ignorant  i must be more explicit  n     n     on the very day of my coming home from longbourn  your uncle had a most n    unexpected visitor  mr  darcy called  and was shut up with him several n    hours  it was all over before i arrived  so my curiosity was not so n    dreadfully racked as  yours  seems to have been  he came to tell mr  n    gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr  wickham were  n    and that he had seen and talked with them both  wickham repeatedly  n    lydia once  from what i can collect  he left derbyshire only one day n    after ourselves  and came to town with the resolution of hunting for n    them  the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to n    himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to n    make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide n    in him  he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride  and n    confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private n    actions open to the world  his character was to speak for itself  he n    called it  therefore  his duty to step forward  and endeavour to remedy n    an evil which had been brought on by himself  if he  had another  n    motive  i am sure it would never disgrace him  he had been some days n    in town  before he was able to discover them  but he had something to n    direct his search  which was more than  we  had  and the consciousness n    of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us  n     n     there is a lady  it seems  a mrs  younge  who was some time ago n    governess to miss darcy  and was dismissed from her charge on some cause n    of disapprobation  though he did not say what  she then took a large n    house in edward-street  and has since maintained herself by letting n    lodgings  this mrs  younge was  he knew  intimately acquainted with n    wickham  and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to n    town  but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he n    wanted  she would not betray her trust  i suppose  without bribery and n    corruption  for she really did know where her friend was to be found  n    wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london  and had n    she been able to receive them into her house  they would have taken up n    their abode with her  at length  however  our kind friend procured the n    wished-for direction  they were in ---- street  he saw wickham  and n    afterwards insisted on seeing lydia  his first object with her  he n    acknowledged  had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful n    situation  and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed n    on to receive her  offering his assistance  as far as it would go  but n    he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was  she cared n    for none of her friends  she wanted no help of his  she would not hear n    of leaving wickham  she was sure they should be married some time or n    other  and it did not much signify when  since such were her feelings  n    it only remained  he thought  to secure and expedite a marriage  which  n    in his very first conversation with wickham  he easily learnt had never n    been  his  design  he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment  n    on account of some debts of honour  which were very pressing  and n    scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia s flight on her n    own folly alone  he meant to resign his commission immediately  and as n    to his future situation  he could conjecture very little about it  he n    must go somewhere  but he did not know where  and he knew he should have n    nothing to live on  n     n     mr  darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once  though n    mr  bennet was not imagined to be very rich  he would have been able n    to do something for him  and his situation must have been benefited by n    marriage  but he found  in reply to this question  that wickham still n    cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in n    some other country  under such circumstances  however  he was not likely n    to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief  n     n     they met several times  for there was much to be discussed  wickham of n    course wanted more than he could get  but at length was reduced to be n    reasonable  n     n     every thing being settled between  them   mr  darcy  s next step was to n    make your uncle acquainted with it  and he first called in gracechurch n    street the evening before i came home  but mr  gardiner could not be n    seen  and mr  darcy found  on further inquiry  that your father was n    still with him  but would quit town the next morning  he did not judge n    your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your n    uncle  and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the n    departure of the former  he did not leave his name  and till the next n    day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business  n     n     on saturday he came again  your father was gone  your uncle at home  n    and  as i said before  they had a great deal of talk together  n     n     they met again on sunday  and then  i  saw him too  it was not all n    settled before monday  as soon as it was  the express was sent off to n    longbourn  but our visitor was very obstinate  i fancy  lizzy  that n    obstinacy is the real defect of his character  after all  he has been n    accused of many faults at different times  but  this  is the true one  n    nothing was to be done that he did not do himself  though i am sure  and n    i do not speak it to be thanked  therefore say nothing about it   your n    uncle would most readily have settled the whole  n     n     they battled it together for a long time  which was more than either n    the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved  but at last your uncle n    was forced to yield  and instead of being allowed to be of use to his n    niece  was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it  n    which went sorely against the grain  and i really believe your letter n    this morning gave him great pleasure  because it required an explanation n    that would rob him of his borrowed feathers  and give the praise where n    it was due  but  lizzy  this must go no farther than yourself  or jane n    at most  n     n     you know pretty well  i suppose  what has been done for the young n    people  his debts are to be paid  amounting  i believe  to considerably n    more than a thousand pounds  another thousand in addition to her own n    settled upon  her   and his commission purchased  the reason why all n    this was to be done by him alone  was such as i have given above  it n    was owing to him  to his reserve and want of proper consideration  that n    wickham s character had been so misunderstood  and consequently that he n    had been received and noticed as he was  perhaps there was some truth n    in  this   though i doubt whether  his  reserve  or  anybody s  reserve  n    can be answerable for the event  but in spite of all this fine talking  n    my dear lizzy  you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would n    never have yielded  if we had not given him credit for  another n    interest  in the affair  n     n     when all this was resolved on  he returned again to his friends  who n    were still staying at pemberley  but it was agreed that he should be in n    london once more when the wedding took place  and all money matters were n    then to receive the last finish  n     n     i believe i have now told you every thing  it is a relation which n    you tell me is to give you great surprise  i hope at least it will not n    afford you any displeasure  lydia came to us  and wickham had constant n    admission to the house   he  was exactly what he had been  when i n    knew him in hertfordshire  but i would not tell you how little i was n    satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us  if i had not n    perceived  by jane s letter last wednesday  that her conduct on coming n    home was exactly of a piece with it  and therefore what i now tell n    you can give you no fresh pain  i talked to her repeatedly in the most n    serious manner  representing to her all the wickedness of what she had n    done  and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family  if she n    heard me  it was by good luck  for i am sure she did not listen  i was n    sometimes quite provoked  but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and n    jane  and for their sakes had patience with her  n     n     mr  darcy was punctual in his return  and as lydia informed you  n    attended the wedding  he dined with us the next day  and was to leave n    town again on wednesday or thursday  will you be very angry with me  my n    dear lizzy  if i take this opportunity of saying  what i was never bold n    enough to say before  how much i like him  his behaviour to us has  n    in every respect  been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire  his n    understanding and opinions all please me  he wants nothing but a little n    more liveliness  and  that   if he marry  prudently   his wife may teach n    him  i thought him very sly --he hardly ever mentioned your name  but n    slyness seems the fashion  n     n     pray forgive me if i have been very presuming  or at least do not n    punish me so far as to exclude me from p  i shall never be quite happy n    till i have been all round the park  a low phaeton  with a nice little n    pair of ponies  would be the very thing  n     n     but i must write no more  the children have been wanting me this half n    hour  n     n     yours  very sincerely  n     n     m  gardiner   n     n    the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits  n    in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the n    greatest share  the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had n    produced of what mr  darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s n    match  which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too n    great to be probable  and at the same time dreaded to be just  from the n    pain of obligation  were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true  n    he had followed them purposely to town  he had taken on himself all n    the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research  in which n    supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and n    despise  and where he was reduced to meet  frequently meet  reason n    with  persuade  and finally bribe  the man whom he always most wished to n    avoid  and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce  he had n    done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem  her n    heart did whisper that he had done it for her  but it was a hope shortly n    checked by other considerations  and she soon felt that even her vanity n    was insufficient  when required to depend on his affection for her--for n    a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so n    natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham  brother-in-law n    of wickham  every kind of pride must revolt from the connection  he had  n    to be sure  done much  she was ashamed to think how much  but he had n    given a reason for his interference  which asked no extraordinary n    stretch of belief  it was reasonable that he should feel he had been n    wrong  he had liberality  and he had the means of exercising it  and n    though she would not place herself as his principal inducement  she n    could  perhaps  believe that remaining partiality for her might assist n    his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially n    concerned  it was painful  exceedingly painful  to know that they were n    under obligations to a person who could never receive a return  they n    owed the restoration of lydia  her character  every thing  to him  oh  n    how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever n    encouraged  every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him  for n    herself she was humbled  but she was proud of him  proud that in a cause n    of compassion and honour  he had been able to get the better of himself  n    she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again  it n    was hardly enough  but it pleased her  she was even sensible of some n    pleasure  though mixed with regret  on finding how steadfastly both she n    and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted n    between mr  darcy and herself  n     n    she was roused from her seat  and her reflections  by some one s n    approach  and before she could strike into another path  she was n    overtaken by wickham  n     n     i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble  my dear sister   said he  n    as he joined her  n     n     you certainly do   she replied with a smile   but it does not follow n    that the interruption must be unwelcome   n     n     i should be sorry indeed  if it were  we were always good friends  and n    now we are better   n     n     true  are the others coming out   n     n     i do not know  mrs  bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to n    meryton  and so  my dear sister  i find  from our uncle and aunt  that n    you have actually seen pemberley   n     n    she replied in the affirmative  n     n     i almost envy you the pleasure  and yet i believe it would be too much n    for me  or else i could take it in my way to newcastle  and you saw the n    old housekeeper  i suppose  poor reynolds  she was always very fond of n    me  but of course she did not mention my name to you   n     n     yes  she did   n     n     and what did she say   n     n     that you were gone into the army  and she was afraid had--not turned n    out well  at such a distance as  that   you know  things are strangely n    misrepresented   n     n     certainly   he replied  biting his lips  elizabeth hoped she had n    silenced him  but he soon afterwards said  n     n     i was surprised to see darcy in town last month  we passed each other n    several times  i wonder what he can be doing there   n     n     perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh   said n    elizabeth   it must be something particular  to take him there at this n    time of year   n     n     undoubtedly  did you see him while you were at lambton  i thought i n    understood from the gardiners that you had   n     n     yes  he introduced us to his sister   n     n     and do you like her   n     n     very much   n     n     i have heard  indeed  that she is uncommonly improved within this year n    or two  when i last saw her  she was not very promising  i am very glad n    you liked her  i hope she will turn out well   n     n     i dare say she will  she has got over the most trying age   n     n     did you go by the village of kympton   n     n     i do not recollect that we did   n     n     i mention it  because it is the living which i ought to have had  a n    most delightful place --excellent parsonage house  it would have suited n    me in every respect   n     n     how should you have liked making sermons   n     n     exceedingly well  i should have considered it as part of my duty  n    and the exertion would soon have been nothing  one ought not to n    repine --but  to be sure  it would have been such a thing for me  the n    quiet  the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas n    of happiness  but it was not to be  did you ever hear darcy mention the n    circumstance  when you were in kent   n     n     i have heard from authority  which i thought  as good   that it was n    left you conditionally only  and at the will of the present patron   n     n     you have  yes  there was something in  that   i told you so from the n    first  you may remember   n     n     i  did  hear  too  that there was a time  when sermon-making was not n    so palatable to you as it seems to be at present  that you actually n    declared your resolution of never taking orders  and that the business n    had been compromised accordingly   n     n     you did  and it was not wholly without foundation  you may remember n    what i told you on that point  when first we talked of it   n     n    they were now almost at the door of the house  for she had walked fast n    to get rid of him  and unwilling  for her sister s sake  to provoke him  n    she only said in reply  with a good-humoured smile  n     n     come  mr  wickham  we are brother and sister  you know  do not let n    us quarrel about the past  in future  i hope we shall be always of one n    mind   n     n    she held out her hand  he kissed it with affectionate gallantry  though n    he hardly knew how to look  and they entered the house  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    mr  wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he n    never again distressed himself  or provoked his dear sister elizabeth  n    by introducing the subject of it  and she was pleased to find that she n    had said enough to keep him quiet  n     n    the day of his and lydia s departure soon came  and mrs  bennet was n    forced to submit to a separation  which  as her husband by no means n    entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle  was likely to n    continue at least a twelvemonth  n     n     oh  my dear lydia   she cried   when shall we meet again   n     n     oh  lord  i don  t know  not these two or three years  perhaps   n     n     write to me very often  my dear   n     n     as often as i can  but you know married women have never much time for n    writing  my sisters may write to  me   they will have nothing else to n    do   n     n    mr  wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s  he n    smiled  looked handsome  and said many pretty things  n     n     he is as fine a fellow   said mr  bennet  as soon as they were out of n    the house   as ever i saw  he simpers  and smirks  and makes love to n    us all  i am prodigiously proud of him  i defy even sir william lucas n    himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law   n     n    the loss of her daughter made mrs  bennet very dull for several days  n     n     i often think   said she   that there is nothing so bad as parting with n    one  s friends  one seems so forlorn without them   n     n     this is the consequence  you see  madam  of marrying a daughter   said n    elizabeth   it must make you better satisfied that your other four are n    single   n     n     it is no such thing  lydia does not leave me because she is married  n    but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off  if n    that had been nearer  she would not have gone so soon   n     n    but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly n    relieved  and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope  by an n    article of news which then began to be in circulation  the housekeeper n    at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her n    master  who was coming down in a day or two  to shoot there for several n    weeks  mrs  bennet was quite in the fidgets  she looked at jane  and n    smiled and shook her head by turns  n     n     well  well  and so mr  bingley is coming down  sister    for mrs  n    phillips first brought her the news    well  so much the better  not n    that i care about it  though  he is nothing to us  you know  and i am n    sure  i  never want to see him again  but  however  he is very welcome n    to come to netherfield  if he likes it  and who knows what  may  happen  n    but that is nothing to us  you know  sister  we agreed long ago never to n    mention a word about it  and so  is it quite certain he is coming   n     n     you may depend on it   replied the other   for mrs  nicholls was in n    meryton last night  i saw her passing by  and went out myself on purpose n    to know the truth of it  and she told me that it was certain true  he n    comes down on thursday at the latest  very likely on wednesday  she was n    going to the butcher s  she told me  on purpose to order in some meat on n    wednesday  and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed   n     n    miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing n    colour  it was many months since she had mentioned his name to n    elizabeth  but now  as soon as they were alone together  she said  n     n     i saw you look at me to-day  lizzy  when my aunt told us of the present n    report  and i know i appeared distressed  but don t imagine it was from n    any silly cause  i was only confused for the moment  because i felt that n    i  should  be looked at  i do assure you that the news does not affect n    me either with pleasure or pain  i am glad of one thing  that he comes n    alone  because we shall see the less of him  not that i am afraid of n     myself   but i dread other people  s remarks   n     n    elizabeth did not know what to make of it  had she not seen him in n    derbyshire  she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no n    other view than what was acknowledged  but she still thought him partial n    to jane  and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming n    there  with  his friend s permission  or being bold enough to come n    without it  n     n     yet it is hard   she sometimes thought   that this poor man cannot n    come to a house which he has legally hired  without raising all this n    speculation  i  will  leave him to himself   n     n    in spite of what her sister declared  and really believed to be her n    feelings in the expectation of his arrival  elizabeth could easily n    perceive that her spirits were affected by it  they were more disturbed  n    more unequal  than she had often seen them  n     n    the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents  n    about a twelvemonth ago  was now brought forward again  n     n     as soon as ever mr  bingley comes  my dear   said mrs  bennet   you n    will wait on him of course   n     n     no  no  you forced me into visiting him last year  and promised  if i n    went to see him  he should marry one of my daughters  but it ended in n    nothing  and i will not be sent on a fool  s errand again   n     n    his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention n    would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen  on his returning to n    netherfield  n     n       tis an etiquette i despise   said he   if he wants our society  n    let him seek it  he knows where we live  i will not spend my hours n    in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back n    again   n     n     well  all i know is  that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait n    on him  but  however  that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here  i n    am determined  we must have mrs  long and the gouldings soon  that will n    make thirteen with ourselves  so there will be just room at table for n    him   n     n    consoled by this resolution  she was the better able to bear her n    husband s incivility  though it was very mortifying to know that her n    neighbours might all see mr  bingley  in consequence of it  before n     they  did  as the day of his arrival drew near -- n     n     i begin to be sorry that he comes at all   said jane to her sister   it n    would be nothing  i could see him with perfect indifference  but i can n    hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of  my mother means well  n    but she does not know  no one can know  how much i suffer from what she n    says  happy shall i be  when his stay at netherfield is over   n     n     i wish i could say anything to comfort you   replied elizabeth   but it n    is wholly out of my power  you must feel it  and the usual satisfaction n    of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me  because you have n    always so much   n     n    mr  bingley arrived  mrs  bennet  through the assistance of servants  n    contrived to have the earliest tidings of it  that the period of anxiety n    and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could  she counted n    the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent  n    hopeless of seeing him before  but on the third morning after his n    arrival in hertfordshire  she saw him  from her dressing-room window  n    enter the paddock and ride towards the house  n     n    her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy  jane resolutely n    kept her place at the table  but elizabeth  to satisfy her mother  went n    to the window--she looked --she saw mr  darcy with him  and sat down n    again by her sister  n     n     there is a gentleman with him  mamma   said kitty   who can it be   n     n     some acquaintance or other  my dear  i suppose  i am sure i do not n    know   n     n     la   replied kitty   it looks just like that man that used to be with n    him before  mr  what  s-his-name  that tall  proud man   n     n     good gracious  mr  darcy --and so it does  i vow  well  any friend of n    mr  bingley s will always be welcome here  to be sure  but else i must n    say that i hate the very sight of him   n     n    jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern  she knew but little n    of their meeting in derbyshire  and therefore felt for the awkwardness n    which must attend her sister  in seeing him almost for the first time n    after receiving his explanatory letter  both sisters were uncomfortable n    enough  each felt for the other  and of course for themselves  and their n    mother talked on  of her dislike of mr  darcy  and her resolution to be n    civil to him only as mr  bingley s friend  without being heard by either n    of them  but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be n    suspected by jane  to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs  n    gardiner s letter  or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him  n    to jane  he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused  n    and whose merit she had undervalued  but to her own more extensive n    information  he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted n    for the first of benefits  and whom she regarded herself with an n    interest  if not quite so tender  at least as reasonable and just as n    what jane felt for bingley  her astonishment at his coming--at his n    coming to netherfield  to longbourn  and voluntarily seeking her again  n    was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered n    behaviour in derbyshire  n     n    the colour which had been driven from her face  returned for half a n    minute with an additional glow  and a smile of delight added lustre to n    her eyes  as she thought for that space of time that his affection and n    wishes must still be unshaken  but she would not be secure  n     n     let me first see how he behaves   said she   it will then be early n    enough for expectation   n     n    she sat intently at work  striving to be composed  and without daring to n    lift up her eyes  till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of n    her sister as the servant was approaching the door  jane looked a little n    paler than usual  but more sedate than elizabeth had expected  on the n    gentlemen s appearing  her colour increased  yet she received them with n    tolerable ease  and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any n    symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance  n     n    elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow  and sat down n    again to her work  with an eagerness which it did not often command  she n    had ventured only one glance at darcy  he looked serious  as usual  and  n    she thought  more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire  than as n    she had seen him at pemberley  but  perhaps he could not in her mother s n    presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt  it was a painful  but n    not an improbable  conjecture  n     n    bingley  she had likewise seen for an instant  and in that short period n    saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed  he was received by mrs  n    bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed  n    especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of n    her curtsey and address to his friend  n     n    elizabeth  particularly  who knew that her mother owed to the latter n    the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy  n    was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill n    applied  n     n    darcy  after inquiring of her how mr  and mrs  gardiner did  a question n    which she could not answer without confusion  said scarcely anything  he n    was not seated by her  perhaps that was the reason of his silence  but n    it had not been so in derbyshire  there he had talked to her friends  n    when he could not to herself  but now several minutes elapsed without n    bringing the sound of his voice  and when occasionally  unable to resist n    the impulse of curiosity  she raised her eyes to his face  she as often n    found him looking at jane as at herself  and frequently on no object but n    the ground  more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please  than when n    they last met  were plainly expressed  she was disappointed  and angry n    with herself for being so  n     n     could i expect it to be otherwise   said she   yet why did he come   n     n    she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself  and to n    him she had hardly courage to speak  n     n    she inquired after his sister  but could do no more  n     n     it is a long time  mr  bingley  since you went away   said mrs  bennet  n     n    he readily agreed to it  n     n     i began to be afraid you would never come back again  people  did  say n    you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas  but  however  i hope n    it is not true  a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood  n    since you went away  miss lucas is married and settled  and one of my n    own daughters  i suppose you have heard of it  indeed  you must have n    seen it in the papers  it was in the times and the courier  i know  n    though it was not put in as it ought to be  it was only said   lately  n    george wickham  esq  to miss lydia bennet   without there being a n    syllable said of her father  or the place where she lived  or anything  n    it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too  and i wonder how he came to n    make such an awkward business of it  did you see it   n     n    bingley replied that he did  and made his congratulations  elizabeth n    dared not lift up her eyes  how mr  darcy looked  therefore  she could n    not tell  n     n     it is a delightful thing  to be sure  to have a daughter well married   n    continued her mother   but at the same time  mr  bingley  it is very n    hard to have her taken such a way from me  they are gone down to n    newcastle  a place quite northward  it seems  and there they are to stay n    i do not know how long  his regiment is there  for i suppose you have n    heard of his leaving the ----shire  and of his being gone into the n    regulars  thank heaven  he has  some  friends  though perhaps not so n    many as he deserves   n     n    elizabeth  who knew this to be levelled at mr  darcy  was in such n    misery of shame  that she could hardly keep her seat  it drew from her  n    however  the exertion of speaking  which nothing else had so effectually n    done before  and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in n    the country at present  a few weeks  he believed  n     n     when you have killed all your own birds  mr  bingley   said her mother  n     i beg you will come here  and shoot as many as you please on mr  n    bennet s manor  i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you  and n    will save all the best of the covies for you   n     n    elizabeth s misery increased  at such unnecessary  such officious n    attention  were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had n    flattered them a year ago  every thing  she was persuaded  would be n    hastening to the same vexatious conclusion  at that instant  she felt n    that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for n    moments of such painful confusion  n     n     the first wish of my heart   said she to herself   is never more to n    be in company with either of them  their society can afford no pleasure n    that will atone for such wretchedness as this  let me never see either n    one or the other again   n     n    yet the misery  for which years of happiness were to offer no n    compensation  received soon afterwards material relief  from observing n    how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her n    former lover  when first he came in  he had spoken to her but little  n    but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention  he n    found her as handsome as she had been last year  as good natured  and n    as unaffected  though not quite so chatty  jane was anxious that no n    difference should be perceived in her at all  and was really persuaded n    that she talked as much as ever  but her mind was so busily engaged  n    that she did not always know when she was silent  n     n    when the gentlemen rose to go away  mrs  bennet was mindful of her n    intended civility  and they were invited and engaged to dine at n    longbourn in a few days time  n     n     you are quite a visit in my debt  mr  bingley   she added   for when n    you went to town last winter  you promised to take a family dinner with n    us  as soon as you returned  i have not forgot  you see  and i assure n    you  i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep n    your engagement   n     n    bingley looked a little silly at this reflection  and said something of n    his concern at having been prevented by business  they then went away  n     n    mrs  bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine n    there that day  but  though she always kept a very good table  she did n    not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man n    on whom she had such anxious designs  or satisfy the appetite and pride n    of one who had ten thousand a year  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    as soon as they were gone  elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits  n    or in other words  to dwell without interruption on those subjects that n    must deaden them more  mr  darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her  n     n     why  if he came only to be silent  grave  and indifferent   said she  n     did he come at all   n     n    she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure  n     n     he could be still amiable  still pleasing  to my uncle and aunt  when n    he was in town  and why not to me  if he fears me  why come hither  if n    he no longer cares for me  why silent  teasing  teasing  man  i will n    think no more about him   n     n    her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach n    of her sister  who joined her with a cheerful look  which showed her n    better satisfied with their visitors  than elizabeth  n     n     now   said she   that this first meeting is over  i feel perfectly n    easy  i know my own strength  and i shall never be embarrassed again by n    his coming  i am glad he dines here on tuesday  it will then be publicly n    seen that  on both sides  we meet only as common and indifferent n    acquaintance   n     n     yes  very indifferent indeed   said elizabeth  laughingly   oh  jane  n    take care   n     n     my dear lizzy  you cannot think me so weak  as to be in danger now   n     n     i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with n    you as ever   n     n                                        n     n    they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday  and mrs  bennet  in n    the meanwhile  was giving way to all the happy schemes  which the good n    humour and common politeness of bingley  in half an hour s visit  had n    revived  n     n    on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn  and the two n    who were most anxiously expected  to the credit of their punctuality n    as sportsmen  were in very good time  when they repaired to the n    dining-room  elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take n    the place  which  in all their former parties  had belonged to him  by n    her sister  her prudent mother  occupied by the same ideas  forbore n    to invite him to sit by herself  on entering the room  he seemed to n    hesitate  but jane happened to look round  and happened to smile  it was n    decided  he placed himself by her  n     n    elizabeth  with a triumphant sensation  looked towards his friend  n    he bore it with noble indifference  and she would have imagined that n    bingley had received his sanction to be happy  had she not seen his eyes n    likewise turned towards mr  darcy  with an expression of half-laughing n    alarm  n     n    his behaviour to her sister was such  during dinner time  as showed an n    admiration of her  which  though more guarded than formerly  persuaded n    elizabeth  that if left wholly to himself  jane s happiness  and his n    own  would be speedily secured  though she dared not depend upon the n    consequence  she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour  it n    gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast  for she was in n    no cheerful humour  mr  darcy was almost as far from her as the table n    could divide them  he was on one side of her mother  she knew how little n    such a situation would give pleasure to either  or make either appear to n    advantage  she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse  but n    she could see how seldom they spoke to each other  and how formal and n    cold was their manner whenever they did  her mother s ungraciousness  n    made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind  n    and she would  at times  have given anything to be privileged to tell n    him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the n    family  n     n    she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of n    bringing them together  that the whole of the visit would not pass away n    without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than n    the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance  anxious n    and uneasy  the period which passed in the drawing-room  before the n    gentlemen came  was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her n    uncivil  she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all n    her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend  n     n     if he does not come to me   then    said she   i shall give him up for n    ever   n     n    the gentlemen came  and she thought he looked as if he would have n    answered her hopes  but  alas  the ladies had crowded round the table  n    where miss bennet was making tea  and elizabeth pouring out the coffee  n    in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her n    which would admit of a chair  and on the gentlemen s approaching  one of n    the girls moved closer to her than ever  and said  in a whisper  n     n     the men shan  t come and part us  i am determined  we want none of them  n    do we   n     n    darcy had walked away to another part of the room  she followed him with n    her eyes  envied everyone to whom he spoke  had scarcely patience enough n    to help anybody to coffee  and then was enraged against herself for n    being so silly  n     n     a man who has once been refused  how could i ever be foolish enough to n    expect a renewal of his love  is there one among the sex  who would not n    protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman  n    there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings   n     n    she was a little revived  however  by his bringing back his coffee cup n    himself  and she seized the opportunity of saying  n     n     is your sister at pemberley still   n     n     yes  she will remain there till christmas   n     n     and quite alone  have all her friends left her   n     n     mrs  annesley is with her  the others have been gone on to scarborough  n    these three weeks   n     n    she could think of nothing more to say  but if he wished to converse n    with her  he might have better success  he stood by her  however  for n    some minutes  in silence  and  at last  on the young lady s whispering n    to elizabeth again  he walked away  n     n    when the tea-things were removed  and the card-tables placed  the ladies n    all rose  and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him  n    when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her n    mother s rapacity for whist players  and in a few moments after seated n    with the rest of the party  she now lost every expectation of pleasure  n    they were confined for the evening at different tables  and she had n    nothing to hope  but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side n    of the room  as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself  n     n    mrs  bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to n    supper  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the n    others  and she had no opportunity of detaining them  n     n     well girls   said she  as soon as they were left to themselves   what n    say you to the day  i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well  n    i assure you  the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw  the n    venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so n    fat a haunch  the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the n    lucases  last week  and even mr  darcy acknowledged  that the partridges n    were remarkably well done  and i suppose he has two or three french n    cooks at least  and  my dear jane  i never saw you look in greater n    beauty  mrs  long said so too  for i asked her whether you did not  and n    what do you think she said besides   ah  mrs  bennet  we shall have her n    at netherfield at last   she did indeed  i do think mrs  long is as good n    a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls  n    and not at all handsome  i like them prodigiously   n     n    mrs  bennet  in short  was in very great spirits  she had seen enough of n    bingley s behaviour to jane  to be convinced that she would get him at n    last  and her expectations of advantage to her family  when in a happy n    humour  were so far beyond reason  that she was quite disappointed at n    not seeing him there again the next day  to make his proposals  n     n     it has been a very agreeable day   said miss bennet to elizabeth   the n    party seemed so well selected  so suitable one with the other  i hope we n    may often meet again   n     n    elizabeth smiled  n     n     lizzy  you must not do so  you must not suspect me  it mortifies me  n    i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an n    agreeable and sensible young man  without having a wish beyond it  i am n    perfectly satisfied  from what his manners now are  that he never had n    any design of engaging my affection  it is only that he is blessed n    with greater sweetness of address  and a stronger desire of generally n    pleasing  than any other man   n     n     you are very cruel   said her sister   you will not let me smile  and n    are provoking me to it every moment   n     n     how hard it is in some cases to be believed   n     n     and how impossible in others   n     n     but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i n    acknowledge   n     n     that is a question which i hardly know how to answer  we all love to n    instruct  though we can teach only what is not worth knowing  forgive n    me  and if you persist in indifference  do not make me your confidante   n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    a few days after this visit  mr  bingley called again  and alone  his n    friend had left him that morning for london  but was to return home in n    ten days time  he sat with them above an hour  and was in remarkably n    good spirits  mrs  bennet invited him to dine with them  but  with many n    expressions of concern  he confessed himself engaged elsewhere  n     n     next time you call   said she   i hope we shall be more lucky   n     n    he should be particularly happy at any time  etc  etc   and if she would n    give him leave  would take an early opportunity of waiting on them  n     n     can you come to-morrow   n     n    yes  he had no engagement at all for to-morrow  and her invitation was n    accepted with alacrity  n     n    he came  and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them n    dressed  in ran mrs  bennet to her daughter s room  in her dressing n    gown  and with her hair half finished  crying out  n     n     my dear jane  make haste and hurry down  he is come--mr  bingley is n    come  he is  indeed  make haste  make haste  here  sarah  come to miss n    bennet this moment  and help her on with her gown  never mind miss n    lizzy  s hair   n     n     we will be down as soon as we can   said jane   but i dare say kitty is n    forwarder than either of us  for she went up stairs half an hour ago   n     n     oh  hang kitty  what has she to do with it  come be quick  be quick  n    where is your sash  my dear   n     n    but when her mother was gone  jane would not be prevailed on to go down n    without one of her sisters  n     n    the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the n    evening  after tea  mr  bennet retired to the library  as was his n    custom  and mary went up stairs to her instrument  two obstacles of n    the five being thus removed  mrs  bennet sat looking and winking at n    elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time  without making any n    impression on them  elizabeth would not observe her  and when at last n    kitty did  she very innocently said   what is the matter mamma  what do n    you keep winking at me for  what am i to do   n     n     nothing child  nothing  i did not wink at you   she then sat still n    five minutes longer  but unable to waste such a precious occasion  she n    suddenly got up  and saying to kitty   come here  my love  i want to n    speak to you   took her out of the room  jane instantly gave a look n    at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation  and her n    entreaty that  she  would not give in to it  in a few minutes  mrs  n    bennet half-opened the door and called out  n     n     lizzy  my dear  i want to speak with you   n     n    elizabeth was forced to go  n     n     we may as well leave them by themselves you know   said her mother  as n    soon as she was in the hall   kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in n    my dressing-room   n     n    elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother  but remained n    quietly in the hall  till she and kitty were out of sight  then returned n    into the drawing-room  n     n    mrs  bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual  bingley was every n    thing that was charming  except the professed lover of her daughter  his n    ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their n    evening party  and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the n    mother  and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command n    of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter  n     n    he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper  and before he went n    away  an engagement was formed  chiefly through his own and mrs  n    bennet s means  for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband  n     n    after this day  jane said no more of her indifference  not a word passed n    between the sisters concerning bingley  but elizabeth went to bed in n    the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded  unless mr  darcy n    returned within the stated time  seriously  however  she felt tolerably n    persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s n    concurrence  n     n    bingley was punctual to his appointment  and he and mr  bennet spent n    the morning together  as had been agreed on  the latter was much more n    agreeable than his companion expected  there was nothing of presumption n    or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule  or disgust him into n    silence  and he was more communicative  and less eccentric  than the n    other had ever seen him  bingley of course returned with him to dinner  n    and in the evening mrs  bennet s invention was again at work to get n    every body away from him and her daughter  elizabeth  who had a letter n    to write  went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea  n    for as the others were all going to sit down to cards  she could not be n    wanted to counteract her mother s schemes  n     n    but on returning to the drawing-room  when her letter was finished  she n    saw  to her infinite surprise  there was reason to fear that her mother n    had been too ingenious for her  on opening the door  she perceived her n    sister and bingley standing together over the hearth  as if engaged in n    earnest conversation  and had this led to no suspicion  the faces of n    both  as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other  would n    have told it all  their situation was awkward enough  but  hers  she n    thought was still worse  not a syllable was uttered by either  and n    elizabeth was on the point of going away again  when bingley  who as n    well as the other had sat down  suddenly rose  and whispering a few n    words to her sister  ran out of the room  n     n    jane could have no reserves from elizabeth  where confidence would give n    pleasure  and instantly embracing her  acknowledged  with the liveliest n    emotion  that she was the happiest creature in the world  n     n       tis too much   she added   by far too much  i do not deserve it  oh  n    why is not everybody as happy   n     n    elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity  a warmth  n    a delight  which words could but poorly express  every sentence of n    kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane  but she would not n    allow herself to stay with her sister  or say half that remained to be n    said for the present  n     n     i must go instantly to my mother   she cried   i would not on any n    account trifle with her affectionate solicitude  or allow her to hear it n    from anyone but myself  he is gone to my father already  oh  lizzy  to n    know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear n    family  how shall i bear so much happiness   n     n    she then hastened away to her mother  who had purposely broken up the n    card party  and was sitting up stairs with kitty  n     n    elizabeth  who was left by herself  now smiled at the rapidity and ease n    with which an affair was finally settled  that had given them so many n    previous months of suspense and vexation  n     n     and this   said she   is the end of all his friend  s anxious n    circumspection  of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance  the n    happiest  wisest  most reasonable end   n     n    in a few minutes she was joined by bingley  whose conference with her n    father had been short and to the purpose  n     n     where is your sister   said he hastily  as he opened the door  n     n     with my mother up stairs  she will be down in a moment  i dare say   n     n    he then shut the door  and  coming up to her  claimed the good wishes n    and affection of a sister  elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed n    her delight in the prospect of their relationship  they shook hands with n    great cordiality  and then  till her sister came down  she had to listen n    to all he had to say of his own happiness  and of jane s perfections  n    and in spite of his being a lover  elizabeth really believed all his n    expectations of felicity to be rationally founded  because they had for n    basis the excellent understanding  and super-excellent disposition of n    jane  and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and n    himself  n     n    it was an evening of no common delight to them all  the satisfaction of n    miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face  as n    made her look handsomer than ever  kitty simpered and smiled  and hoped n    her turn was coming soon  mrs  bennet could not give her consent or n    speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings  n    though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour  and when n    mr  bennet joined them at supper  his voice and manner plainly showed n    how really happy he was  n     n    not a word  however  passed his lips in allusion to it  till their n    visitor took his leave for the night  but as soon as he was gone  he n    turned to his daughter  and said  n     n     jane  i congratulate you  you will be a very happy woman   n     n    jane went to him instantly  kissed him  and thanked him for his n    goodness  n     n     you are a good girl   he replied   and i have great pleasure in n    thinking you will be so happily settled  i have not a doubt of your n    doing very well together  your tempers are by no means unlike  you are n    each of you so complying  that nothing will ever be resolved on  so n    easy  that every servant will cheat you  and so generous  that you will n    always exceed your income   n     n     i hope not so  imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be n    unpardonable in me   n     n     exceed their income  my dear mr  bennet   cried his wife   what are you n    talking of  why  he has four or five thousand a year  and very likely n    more   then addressing her daughter   oh  my dear  dear jane  i am so n    happy  i am sure i shan t get a wink of sleep all night  i knew how it n    would be  i always said it must be so  at last  i was sure you could not n    be so beautiful for nothing  i remember  as soon as ever i saw him  when n    he first came into hertfordshire last year  i thought how likely it was n    that you should come together  oh  he is the handsomest young man that n    ever was seen   n     n    wickham  lydia  were all forgotten  jane was beyond competition her n    favourite child  at that moment  she cared for no other  her younger n    sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness n    which she might in future be able to dispense  n     n    mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield  and kitty n    begged very hard for a few balls there every winter  n     n    bingley  from this time  was of course a daily visitor at longbourn  n    coming frequently before breakfast  and always remaining till after n    supper  unless when some barbarous neighbour  who could not be enough n    detested  had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself n    obliged to accept  n     n    elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister  for n    while he was present  jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else  n    but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours n    of separation that must sometimes occur  in the absence of jane  he n    always attached himself to elizabeth  for the pleasure of talking of n    her  and when bingley was gone  jane constantly sought the same means of n    relief  n     n     he has made me so happy   said she  one evening   by telling me that he n    was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring  i had not believed n    it possible   n     n     i suspected as much   replied elizabeth   but how did he account for n    it   n     n     it must have been his sister  s doing  they were certainly no friends to n    his acquaintance with me  which i cannot wonder at  since he might have n    chosen so much more advantageously in many respects  but when they see  n    as i trust they will  that their brother is happy with me  they will n    learn to be contented  and we shall be on good terms again  though we n    can never be what we once were to each other   n     n     that is the most unforgiving speech   said elizabeth   that i ever n    heard you utter  good girl  it would vex me  indeed  to see you again n    the dupe of miss bingley  s pretended regard   n     n     would you believe it  lizzy  that when he went to town last november  n    he really loved me  and nothing but a persuasion of  my  being n    indifferent would have prevented his coming down again   n     n     he made a little mistake to be sure  but it is to the credit of his n    modesty   n     n    this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence  and n    the little value he put on his own good qualities  elizabeth was pleased n    to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend  for  n    though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world  she n    knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him  n     n     i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed   cried n    jane   oh  lizzy  why am i thus singled from my family  and blessed n    above them all  if i could but see  you  as happy  if there  were  but n    such another man for you   n     n     if you were to give me forty such men  i never could be so happy as n    you  till i have your disposition  your goodness  i never can have your n    happiness  no  no  let me shift for myself  and  perhaps  if i have very n    good luck  i may meet with another mr  collins in time   n     n    the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a n    secret  mrs  bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs  phillips  n    and she ventured  without any permission  to do the same by all her n    neighbours in meryton  n     n    the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the n    world  though only a few weeks before  when lydia had first run away  n    they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    one morning  about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been n    formed  as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the n    dining-room  their attention was suddenly drawn to the window  by the n    sound of a carriage  and they perceived a chaise and four driving up n    the lawn  it was too early in the morning for visitors  and besides  the n    equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours  the horses n    were post  and neither the carriage  nor the livery of the servant who n    preceded it  were familiar to them  as it was certain  however  that n    somebody was coming  bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid n    the confinement of such an intrusion  and walk away with him into the n    shrubbery  they both set off  and the conjectures of the remaining three n    continued  though with little satisfaction  till the door was thrown n    open and their visitor entered  it was lady catherine de bourgh  n     n    they were of course all intending to be surprised  but their n    astonishment was beyond their expectation  and on the part of mrs  n    bennet and kitty  though she was perfectly unknown to them  even n    inferior to what elizabeth felt  n     n    she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious  made no n    other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the n    head  and sat down without saying a word  elizabeth had mentioned her n    name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance  though no request of n    introduction had been made  n     n    mrs  bennet  all amazement  though flattered by having a guest of such n    high importance  received her with the utmost politeness  after sitting n    for a moment in silence  she said very stiffly to elizabeth  n     n     i hope you are well  miss bennet  that lady  i suppose  is your n    mother   n     n    elizabeth replied very concisely that she was  n     n     and  that  i suppose is one of your sisters   n     n     yes  madam   said mrs  bennet  delighted to speak to lady catherine  n     she is my youngest girl but one  my youngest of all is lately married  n    and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds  walking with a young man n    who  i believe  will soon become a part of the family   n     n     you have a very small park here   returned lady catherine after a short n    silence  n     n     it is nothing in comparison of rosings  my lady  i dare say  but i n    assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas  s   n     n     this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening  in n    summer  the windows are full west   n     n    mrs  bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner  and then n    added  n     n     may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr  and n    mrs  collins well   n     n     yes  very well  i saw them the night before last   n     n    elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from n    charlotte  as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling  but no n    letter appeared  and she was completely puzzled  n     n    mrs  bennet  with great civility  begged her ladyship to take some n    refreshment  but lady catherine very resolutely  and not very politely  n    declined eating anything  and then  rising up  said to elizabeth  n     n     miss bennet  there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness n    on one side of your lawn  i should be glad to take a turn in it  if you n    will favour me with your company   n     n     go  my dear   cried her mother   and show her ladyship about the n    different walks  i think she will be pleased with the hermitage   n     n    elizabeth obeyed  and running into her own room for her parasol  n    attended her noble guest downstairs  as they passed through the n    hall  lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and n    drawing-room  and pronouncing them  after a short survey  to be decent n    looking rooms  walked on  n     n    her carriage remained at the door  and elizabeth saw that her n    waiting-woman was in it  they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk n    that led to the copse  elizabeth was determined to make no effort for n    conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and n    disagreeable  n     n     how could i ever think her like her nephew   said she  as she looked in n    her face  n     n    as soon as they entered the copse  lady catherine began in the following n    manner -- n     n     you can be at no loss  miss bennet  to understand the reason of my n    journey hither  your own heart  your own conscience  must tell you why i n    come   n     n    elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment  n     n     indeed  you are mistaken  madam  i have not been at all able to account n    for the honour of seeing you here   n     n     miss bennet   replied her ladyship  in an angry tone   you ought to n    know  that i am not to be trifled with  but however insincere  you  may n    choose to be  you shall not find  me  so  my character has ever been n    celebrated for its sincerity and frankness  and in a cause of such n    moment as this  i shall certainly not depart from it  a report of a most n    alarming nature reached me two days ago  i was told that not only your n    sister was on the point of being most advantageously married  but that n    you  that miss elizabeth bennet  would  in all likelihood  be soon n    afterwards united to my nephew  my own nephew  mr  darcy  though i n     know  it must be a scandalous falsehood  though i would not injure him n    so much as to suppose the truth of it possible  i instantly resolved n    on setting off for this place  that i might make my sentiments known to n    you   n     n     if you believed it impossible to be true   said elizabeth  colouring n    with astonishment and disdain   i wonder you took the trouble of coming n    so far  what could your ladyship propose by it   n     n     at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted   n     n     your coming to longbourn  to see me and my family   said elizabeth n    coolly   will be rather a confirmation of it  if  indeed  such a report n    is in existence   n     n     if  do you then pretend to be ignorant of it  has it not been n    industriously circulated by yourselves  do you not know that such a n    report is spread abroad   n     n     i never heard that it was   n     n     and can you likewise declare  that there is no foundation for it   n     n     i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship  you may n    ask questions which i shall not choose to answer   n     n     this is not to be borne  miss bennet  i insist on being satisfied  has n    he  has my nephew  made you an offer of marriage   n     n     your ladyship has declared it to be impossible   n     n     it ought to be so  it must be so  while he retains the use of his n    reason  but your arts and allurements may  in a moment of infatuation  n    have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family  you n    may have drawn him in   n     n     if i have  i shall be the last person to confess it   n     n     miss bennet  do you know who i am  i have not been accustomed to such n    language as this  i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world  n    and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns   n     n     but you are not entitled to know mine  nor will such behaviour as this  n    ever induce me to be explicit   n     n     let me be rightly understood  this match  to which you have the n    presumption to aspire  can never take place  no  never  mr  darcy is n    engaged to my daughter  now what have you to say   n     n     only this  that if he is so  you can have no reason to suppose he will n    make an offer to me   n     n    lady catherine hesitated for a moment  and then replied  n     n     the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind  from their infancy  n    they have been intended for each other  it was the favourite wish of n     his  mother  as well as of hers  while in their cradles  we planned n    the union  and now  at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would n    be accomplished in their marriage  to be prevented by a young woman of n    inferior birth  of no importance in the world  and wholly unallied to n    the family  do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends  to his n    tacit engagement with miss de bourgh  are you lost to every feeling of n    propriety and delicacy  have you not heard me say that from his earliest n    hours he was destined for his cousin   n     n     yes  and i had heard it before  but what is that to me  if there is n    no other objection to my marrying your nephew  i shall certainly not n    be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to n    marry miss de bourgh  you both did as much as you could in planning the n    marriage  its completion depended on others  if mr  darcy is neither n    by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin  why is not he to make n    another choice  and if i am that choice  why may not i accept him   n     n     because honour  decorum  prudence  nay  interest  forbid it  yes  n    miss bennet  interest  for do not expect to be noticed by his family or n    friends  if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all  you will n    be censured  slighted  and despised  by everyone connected with him  n    your alliance will be a disgrace  your name will never even be mentioned n    by any of us   n     n     these are heavy misfortunes   replied elizabeth   but the wife of mr  n    darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily n    attached to her situation  that she could  upon the whole  have no cause n    to repine   n     n     obstinate  headstrong girl  i am ashamed of you  is this your gratitude n    for my attentions to you last spring  is nothing due to me on that n    score  let us sit down  you are to understand  miss bennet  that i came n    here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose  nor will n    i be dissuaded from it  i have not been used to submit to any person s n    whims  i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment   n     n      that  will make your ladyship  s situation at present more pitiable  n    but it will have no effect on me   n     n     i will not be interrupted  hear me in silence  my daughter and my n    nephew are formed for each other  they are descended  on the maternal n    side  from the same noble line  and  on the father s  from respectable  n    honourable  and ancient--though untitled--families  their fortune on n    both sides is splendid  they are destined for each other by the voice of n    every member of their respective houses  and what is to divide them  n    the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family  connections  n    or fortune  is this to be endured  but it must not  shall not be  if you n    were sensible of your own good  you would not wish to quit the sphere in n    which you have been brought up   n     n     in marrying your nephew  i should not consider myself as quitting that n    sphere  he is a gentleman  i am a gentleman s daughter  so far we are n    equal   n     n     true  you  are  a gentleman  s daughter  but who was your mother  n    who are your uncles and aunts  do not imagine me ignorant of their n    condition   n     n     whatever my connections may be   said elizabeth   if your nephew does n    not object to them  they can be nothing to  you    n     n     tell me once for all  are you engaged to him   n     n    though elizabeth would not  for the mere purpose of obliging lady n    catherine  have answered this question  she could not but say  after a n    moment s deliberation  n     n     i am not   n     n    lady catherine seemed pleased  n     n     and will you promise me  never to enter into such an engagement   n     n     i will make no promise of the kind   n     n     miss bennet i am shocked and astonished  i expected to find a more n    reasonable young woman  but do not deceive yourself into a belief that n    i will ever recede  i shall not go away till you have given me the n    assurance i require   n     n     and i certainly  never  shall give it  i am not to be intimidated into n    anything so wholly unreasonable  your ladyship wants mr  darcy to marry n    your daughter  but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their n    marriage at all more probable  supposing him to be attached to me  would n    my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin  n    allow me to say  lady catherine  that the arguments with which you have n    supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the n    application was ill-judged  you have widely mistaken my character  if n    you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these  how far your n    nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs  i cannot tell  n    but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine  i must beg  n    therefore  to be importuned no farther on the subject   n     n     not so hasty  if you please  i have by no means done  to all the n    objections i have already urged  i have still another to add  i am n    no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous n    elopement  i know it all  that the young man s marrying her was a n    patched-up business  at the expence of your father and uncles  and is n    such a girl to be my nephew s sister  is her husband  is the son of his n    late father s steward  to be his brother  heaven and earth --of what are n    you thinking  are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted   n     n     you can now have nothing further to say   she resentfully answered  n     you have insulted me in every possible method  i must beg to return to n    the house   n     n    and she rose as she spoke  lady catherine rose also  and they turned n    back  her ladyship was highly incensed  n     n     you have no regard  then  for the honour and credit of my nephew  n    unfeeling  selfish girl  do you not consider that a connection with you n    must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody   n     n     lady catherine  i have nothing further to say  you know my sentiments   n     n     you are then resolved to have him   n     n     i have said no such thing  i am only resolved to act in that manner  n    which will  in my own opinion  constitute my happiness  without n    reference to  you   or to any person so wholly unconnected with me   n     n     it is well  you refuse  then  to oblige me  you refuse to obey the n    claims of duty  honour  and gratitude  you are determined to ruin him in n    the opinion of all his friends  and make him the contempt of the world   n     n     neither duty  nor honour  nor gratitude   replied elizabeth   have any n    possible claim on me  in the present instance  no principle of either n    would be violated by my marriage with mr  darcy  and with regard to the n    resentment of his family  or the indignation of the world  if the former n     were  excited by his marrying me  it would not give me one moment s n    concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in n    the scorn   n     n     and this is your real opinion  this is your final resolve  very well  n    i shall now know how to act  do not imagine  miss bennet  that your n    ambition will ever be gratified  i came to try you  i hoped to find you n    reasonable  but  depend upon it  i will carry my point   n     n    in this manner lady catherine talked on  till they were at the door of n    the carriage  when  turning hastily round  she added   i take no leave n    of you  miss bennet  i send no compliments to your mother  you deserve n    no such attention  i am most seriously displeased   n     n    elizabeth made no answer  and without attempting to persuade her n    ladyship to return into the house  walked quietly into it herself  she n    heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs  her mother n    impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room  to ask why lady n    catherine would not come in again and rest herself  n     n     she did not choose it   said her daughter   she would go   n     n     she is a very fine-looking woman  and her calling here was prodigiously n    civil  for she only came  i suppose  to tell us the collinses were n    well  she is on her road somewhere  i dare say  and so  passing through n    meryton  thought she might as well call on you  i suppose she had n    nothing particular to say to you  lizzy   n     n    elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here  for to n    acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw n    elizabeth into  could not be easily overcome  nor could she  for many n    hours  learn to think of it less than incessantly  lady catherine  it n    appeared  had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings  n    for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr  n    darcy  it was a rational scheme  to be sure  but from what the report n    of their engagement could originate  elizabeth was at a loss to imagine  n    till she recollected that  his  being the intimate friend of bingley  n    and  her  being the sister of jane  was enough  at a time when the n    expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another  to supply n    the idea  she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her n    sister must bring them more frequently together  and her neighbours n    at lucas lodge  therefore  for through their communication with the n    collinses  the report  she concluded  had reached lady catherine   had n    only set that down as almost certain and immediate  which she had looked n    forward to as possible at some future time  n     n    in revolving lady catherine s expressions  however  she could not help n    feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting n    in this interference  from what she had said of her resolution to n    prevent their marriage  it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate n    an application to her nephew  and how  he  might take a similar n    representation of the evils attached to a connection with her  she dared n    not pronounce  she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his n    aunt  or his dependence on her judgment  but it was natural to suppose n    that he thought much higher of her ladyship than  she  could do  and it n    was certain that  in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with  one   n    whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own  his aunt would n    address him on his weakest side  with his notions of dignity  he would n    probably feel that the arguments  which to elizabeth had appeared weak n    and ridiculous  contained much good sense and solid reasoning  n     n    if he had been wavering before as to what he should do  which had often n    seemed likely  the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might n    settle every doubt  and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity n    unblemished could make him  in that case he would return no more  lady n    catherine might see him in her way through town  and his engagement to n    bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way  n     n     if  therefore  an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his n    friend within a few days   she added   i shall know how to understand n    it  i shall then give over every expectation  every wish of his n    constancy  if he is satisfied with only regretting me  when he might n    have obtained my affections and hand  i shall soon cease to regret him n    at all   n     n                                        n     n    the surprise of the rest of the family  on hearing who their visitor had n    been  was very great  but they obligingly satisfied it  with the same n    kind of supposition which had appeased mrs  bennet s curiosity  and n    elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject  n     n    the next morning  as she was going downstairs  she was met by her n    father  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand  n     n     lizzy   said he   i was going to look for you  come into my room   n     n    she followed him thither  and her curiosity to know what he had to n    tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner n    connected with the letter he held  it suddenly struck her that it n    might be from lady catherine  and she anticipated with dismay all the n    consequent explanations  n     n    she followed her father to the fire place  and they both sat down  he n    then said  n     n     i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me n    exceedingly  as it principally concerns yourself  you ought to know its n    contents  i did not know before  that i had two daughters on the brink n    of matrimony  let me congratulate you on a very important conquest   n     n    the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous n    conviction of its being a letter from the nephew  instead of the aunt  n    and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained n    himself at all  or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to n    herself  when her father continued  n     n     you look conscious  young ladies have great penetration in such matters n    as these  but i think i may defy even  your  sagacity  to discover the n    name of your admirer  this letter is from mr  collins   n     n     from mr  collins  and what can  he  have to say   n     n     something very much to the purpose of course  he begins with n    congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter  of n    which  it seems  he has been told by some of the good-natured  gossiping n    lucases  i shall not sport with your impatience  by reading what he says n    on that point  what relates to yourself  is as follows   having thus n    offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs  collins and myself on n    this happy event  let me now add a short hint on the subject of another  n    of which we have been advertised by the same authority  your daughter n    elizabeth  it is presumed  will not long bear the name of bennet  after n    her elder sister has resigned it  and the chosen partner of her fate may n    be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in n    this land   n     n     can you possibly guess  lizzy  who is meant by this    this young n    gentleman is blessed  in a peculiar way  with every thing the heart of n    mortal can most desire --splendid property  noble kindred  and extensive n    patronage  yet in spite of all these temptations  let me warn my cousin n    elizabeth  and yourself  of what evils you may incur by a precipitate n    closure with this gentleman s proposals  which  of course  you will be n    inclined to take immediate advantage of   n     n     have you any idea  lizzy  who this gentleman is  but now it comes out  n     n       my motive for cautioning you is as follows  we have reason to imagine n    that his aunt  lady catherine de bourgh  does not look on the match with n    a friendly eye   n     n      mr  darcy   you see  is the man  now  lizzy  i think i  have  n    surprised you  could he  or the lucases  have pitched on any man within n    the circle of our acquaintance  whose name would have given the lie n    more effectually to what they related  mr  darcy  who never looks at any n    woman but to see a blemish  and who probably never looked at you in his n    life  it is admirable   n     n    elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry  but could only force n    one most reluctant smile  never had his wit been directed in a manner so n    little agreeable to her  n     n     are you not diverted   n     n     oh  yes  pray read on   n     n       after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last n    night  she immediately  with her usual condescension  expressed what she n    felt on the occasion  when it became apparent  that on the score of some n    family objections on the part of my cousin  she would never give her n    consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match  i thought it my duty n    to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin  that she and n    her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about  and not run n    hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned   mr  n    collins moreover adds   i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad n    business has been so well hushed up  and am only concerned that their n    living together before the marriage took place should be so generally n    known  i must not  however  neglect the duties of my station  or refrain n    from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young n    couple into your house as soon as they were married  it was an n    encouragement of vice  and had i been the rector of longbourn  i should n    very strenuously have opposed it  you ought certainly to forgive them  n    as a christian  but never to admit them in your sight  or allow their n    names to be mentioned in your hearing   that is his notion of christian n    forgiveness  the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s n    situation  and his expectation of a young olive-branch  but  lizzy  you n    look as if you did not enjoy it  you are not going to be  missish   n    i hope  and pretend to be affronted at an idle report  for what do we n    live  but to make sport for our neighbours  and laugh at them in our n    turn   n     n     oh   cried elizabeth   i am excessively diverted  but it is so n    strange   n     n     yes-- that  is what makes it amusing  had they fixed on any other man n    it would have been nothing  but  his  perfect indifference  and  your  n    pointed dislike  make it so delightfully absurd  much as i abominate n    writing  i would not give up mr  collins s correspondence for any n    consideration  nay  when i read a letter of his  i cannot help giving n    him the preference even over wickham  much as i value the impudence and n    hypocrisy of my son-in-law  and pray  lizzy  what said lady catherine n    about this report  did she call to refuse her consent   n     n    to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh  and as it had n    been asked without the least suspicion  she was not distressed by n    his repeating it  elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her n    feelings appear what they were not  it was necessary to laugh  when she n    would rather have cried  her father had most cruelly mortified her  by n    what he said of mr  darcy s indifference  and she could do nothing but n    wonder at such a want of penetration  or fear that perhaps  instead of n    his seeing too little  she might have fancied too much  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend  as n    elizabeth half expected mr  bingley to do  he was able to bring darcy n    with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s n    visit  the gentlemen arrived early  and  before mrs  bennet had time n    to tell him of their having seen his aunt  of which her daughter sat n    in momentary dread  bingley  who wanted to be alone with jane  proposed n    their all walking out  it was agreed to  mrs  bennet was not in the n    habit of walking  mary could never spare time  but the remaining five n    set off together  bingley and jane  however  soon allowed the others n    to outstrip them  they lagged behind  while elizabeth  kitty  and darcy n    were to entertain each other  very little was said by either  kitty n    was too much afraid of him to talk  elizabeth was secretly forming a n    desperate resolution  and perhaps he might be doing the same  n     n    they walked towards the lucases  because kitty wished to call upon n    maria  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern  n    when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone  now was the n    moment for her resolution to be executed  and  while her courage was n    high  she immediately said  n     n     mr  darcy  i am a very selfish creature  and  for the sake of giving n    relief to my own feelings  care not how much i may be wounding yours  i n    can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my n    poor sister  ever since i have known it  i have been most anxious to n    acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it  were it known to the rest n    of my family  i should not have merely my own gratitude to express   n     n     i am sorry  exceedingly sorry   replied darcy  in a tone of surprise n    and emotion   that you have ever been informed of what may  in a n    mistaken light  have given you uneasiness  i did not think mrs  gardiner n    was so little to be trusted   n     n     you must not blame my aunt  lydia  s thoughtlessness first betrayed to n    me that you had been concerned in the matter  and  of course  i could n    not rest till i knew the particulars  let me thank you again and again  n    in the name of all my family  for that generous compassion which induced n    you to take so much trouble  and bear so many mortifications  for the n    sake of discovering them   n     n     if you  will  thank me   he replied   let it be for yourself alone  n    that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other n    inducements which led me on  i shall not attempt to deny  but your n     family  owe me nothing  much as i respect them  i believe i thought n    only of  you    n     n    elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word  after a short pause  n    her companion added   you are too generous to trifle with me  if your n    feelings are still what they were last april  tell me so at once   my  n    affections and wishes are unchanged  but one word from you will silence n    me on this subject for ever   n     n    elizabeth  feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of n    his situation  now forced herself to speak  and immediately  though not n    very fluently  gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone n    so material a change  since the period to which he alluded  as to make n    her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances  the n    happiness which this reply produced  was such as he had probably never n    felt before  and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as n    warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do  had elizabeth n    been able to encounter his eye  she might have seen how well the n    expression of heartfelt delight  diffused over his face  became him  n    but  though she could not look  she could listen  and he told her of n    feelings  which  in proving of what importance she was to him  made his n    affection every moment more valuable  n     n    they walked on  without knowing in what direction  there was too much to n    be thought  and felt  and said  for attention to any other objects  she n    soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding n    to the efforts of his aunt  who did call on him in her return through n    london  and there relate her journey to longbourn  its motive  and the n    substance of her conversation with elizabeth  dwelling emphatically on n    every expression of the latter which  in her ladyship s apprehension  n    peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance  in the belief that n    such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise n    from her nephew which she had refused to give  but  unluckily for her n    ladyship  its effect had been exactly contrariwise  n     n     it taught me to hope   said he   as i had scarcely ever allowed myself n    to hope before  i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that  n    had you been absolutely  irrevocably decided against me  you would have n    acknowledged it to lady catherine  frankly and openly   n     n    elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied   yes  you know enough n    of my frankness to believe me capable of  that   after abusing you so n    abominably to your face  i could have no scruple in abusing you to all n    your relations   n     n     what did you say of me  that i did not deserve  for  though your n    accusations were ill-founded  formed on mistaken premises  my n    behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof  it was n    unpardonable  i cannot think of it without abhorrence   n     n     we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that n    evening   said elizabeth   the conduct of neither  if strictly examined  n    will be irreproachable  but since then  we have both  i hope  improved n    in civility   n     n     i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself  the recollection of what i n    then said  of my conduct  my manners  my expressions during the whole of n    it  is now  and has been many months  inexpressibly painful to me  your n    reproof  so well applied  i shall never forget   had you behaved in a n    more gentlemanlike manner   those were your words  you know not  you can n    scarcely conceive  how they have tortured me --though it was some time  n    i confess  before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice   n     n     i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an n    impression  i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such n    a way   n     n     i can easily believe it  you thought me then devoid of every proper n    feeling  i am sure you did  the turn of your countenance i shall never n    forget  as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible n    way that would induce you to accept me   n     n     oh  do not repeat what i then said  these recollections will not do at n    all  i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it   n     n    darcy mentioned his letter   did it   said he   did it soon make you n    think better of me  did you  on reading it  give any credit to its n    contents   n     n    she explained what its effect on her had been  and how gradually all her n    former prejudices had been removed  n     n     i knew   said he   that what i wrote must give you pain  but it was n    necessary  i hope you have destroyed the letter  there was one part n    especially  the opening of it  which i should dread your having the n    power of reading again  i can remember some expressions which might n    justly make you hate me   n     n     the letter shall certainly be burnt  if you believe it essential to the n    preservation of my regard  but  though we have both reason to think my n    opinions not entirely unalterable  they are not  i hope  quite so easily n    changed as that implies   n     n     when i wrote that letter   replied darcy   i believed myself perfectly n    calm and cool  but i am since convinced that it was written in a n    dreadful bitterness of spirit   n     n     the letter  perhaps  began in bitterness  but it did not end so  the n    adieu is charity itself  but think no more of the letter  the feelings n    of the person who wrote  and the person who received it  are now n    so widely different from what they were then  that every unpleasant n    circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten  you must learn some n    of my philosophy  think only of the past as its remembrance gives you n    pleasure   n     n     i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind  your n    retrospections must be so totally void of reproach  that the contentment n    arising from them is not of philosophy  but  what is much better  of n    innocence  but with me  it is not so  painful recollections will intrude n    which cannot  which ought not  to be repelled  i have been a selfish n    being all my life  in practice  though not in principle  as a child i n    was taught what was right  but i was not taught to correct my temper  i n    was given good principles  but left to follow them in pride and conceit  n    unfortunately an only son  for many years an only child   i was spoilt n    by my parents  who  though good themselves  my father  particularly  all n    that was benevolent and amiable   allowed  encouraged  almost taught n    me to be selfish and overbearing  to care for none beyond my own family n    circle  to think meanly of all the rest of the world  to wish at least n    to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own  such i n    was  from eight to eight and twenty  and such i might still have been n    but for you  dearest  loveliest elizabeth  what do i not owe you  you n    taught me a lesson  hard indeed at first  but most advantageous  by you  n    i was properly humbled  i came to you without a doubt of my reception  n    you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman n    worthy of being pleased   n     n     had you then persuaded yourself that i should   n     n     indeed i had  what will you think of my vanity  i believed you to be n    wishing  expecting my addresses   n     n     my manners must have been in fault  but not intentionally  i assure n    you  i never meant to deceive you  but my spirits might often lead me n    wrong  how you must have hated me after  that  evening   n     n     hate you  i was angry perhaps at first  but my anger soon began to take n    a proper direction   n     n     i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me  when we met at n    pemberley  you blamed me for coming   n     n     no indeed  i felt nothing but surprise   n     n     your surprise could not be greater than  mine  in being noticed by you  n    my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness  and i n    confess that i did not expect to receive  more  than my due   n     n     my object then   replied darcy   was to show you  by every civility in n    my power  that i was not so mean as to resent the past  and i hoped to n    obtain your forgiveness  to lessen your ill opinion  by letting you n    see that your reproofs had been attended to  how soon any other wishes n    introduced themselves i can hardly tell  but i believe in about half an n    hour after i had seen you   n     n    he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance  and of her n    disappointment at its sudden interruption  which naturally leading to n    the cause of that interruption  she soon learnt that his resolution of n    following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed n    before he quitted the inn  and that his gravity and thoughtfulness n    there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must n    comprehend  n     n    she expressed her gratitude again  but it was too painful a subject to n    each  to be dwelt on farther  n     n    after walking several miles in a leisurely manner  and too busy to know n    anything about it  they found at last  on examining their watches  that n    it was time to be at home  n     n     what could become of mr  bingley and jane   was a wonder which n    introduced the discussion of their affairs  darcy was delighted with n    their engagement  his friend had given him the earliest information of n    it  n     n     i must ask whether you were surprised   said elizabeth  n     n     not at all  when i went away  i felt that it would soon happen   n     n     that is to say  you had given your permission  i guessed as much   and n    though he exclaimed at the term  she found that it had been pretty much n    the case  n     n     on the evening before my going to london   said he   i made a n    confession to him  which i believe i ought to have made long ago  i n    told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his n    affairs absurd and impertinent  his surprise was great  he had never had n    the slightest suspicion  i told him  moreover  that i believed myself n    mistaken in supposing  as i had done  that your sister was indifferent n    to him  and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was n    unabated  i felt no doubt of their happiness together   n     n    elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his n    friend  n     n     did you speak from your own observation   said she   when you told him n    that my sister loved him  or merely from my information last spring   n     n     from the former  i had narrowly observed her during the two visits n    which i had lately made here  and i was convinced of her affection   n     n     and your assurance of it  i suppose  carried immediate conviction to n    him   n     n     it did  bingley is most unaffectedly modest  his diffidence had n    prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case  but n    his reliance on mine made every thing easy  i was obliged to confess n    one thing  which for a time  and not unjustly  offended him  i could not n    allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months n    last winter  that i had known it  and purposely kept it from him  he was n    angry  but his anger  i am persuaded  lasted no longer than he remained n    in any doubt of your sister s sentiments  he has heartily forgiven me n    now   n     n    elizabeth longed to observe that mr  bingley had been a most delightful n    friend  so easily guided that his worth was invaluable  but she checked n    herself  she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at  n    and it was rather too early to begin  in anticipating the happiness n    of bingley  which of course was to be inferior only to his own  he n    continued the conversation till they reached the house  in the hall they n    parted  n     n     n     n    chapter   n     n     n     my dear lizzy  where can you have been walking to   was a question n    which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room  n    and from all the others when they sat down to table  she had only to n    say in reply  that they had wandered about  till she was beyond her own n    knowledge  she coloured as she spoke  but neither that  nor anything n    else  awakened a suspicion of the truth  n     n    the evening passed quietly  unmarked by anything extraordinary  the n    acknowledged lovers talked and laughed  the unacknowledged were silent  n    darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth  n    and elizabeth  agitated and confused  rather  knew  that she was happy n    than  felt  herself to be so  for  besides the immediate embarrassment  n    there were other evils before her  she anticipated what would be felt n    in the family when her situation became known  she was aware that no n    one liked him but jane  and even feared that with the others it was a n    dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away  n     n    at night she opened her heart to jane  though suspicion was very far n    from miss bennet s general habits  she was absolutely incredulous here  n     n     you are joking  lizzy  this cannot be --engaged to mr  darcy  no  no  n    you shall not deceive me  i know it to be impossible   n     n     this is a wretched beginning indeed  my sole dependence was on you  and n    i am sure nobody else will believe me  if you do not  yet  indeed  i am n    in earnest  i speak nothing but the truth  he still loves me  and we are n    engaged   n     n    jane looked at her doubtingly   oh  lizzy  it cannot be  i know how much n    you dislike him   n     n     you know nothing of the matter   that  is all to be forgot  perhaps i n    did not always love him so well as i do now  but in such cases as n    these  a good memory is unpardonable  this is the last time i shall ever n    remember it myself   n     n    miss bennet still looked all amazement  elizabeth again  and more n    seriously assured her of its truth  n     n     good heaven  can it be really so  yet now i must believe you   cried n    jane   my dear  dear lizzy  i would--i do congratulate you--but are you n    certain  forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be n    happy with him   n     n     there can be no doubt of that  it is settled between us already  that n    we are to be the happiest couple in the world  but are you pleased  n    jane  shall you like to have such a brother   n     n     very  very much  nothing could give either bingley or myself more n    delight  but we considered it  we talked of it as impossible  and do you n    really love him quite well enough  oh  lizzy  do anything rather than n    marry without affection  are you quite sure that you feel what you ought n    to do   n     n     oh  yes  you will only think i feel  more  than i ought to do  when i n    tell you all   n     n     what do you mean   n     n     why  i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley  i am n    afraid you will be angry   n     n     my dearest sister  now  be  serious  i want to talk very seriously  let n    me know every thing that i am to know  without delay  will you tell me n    how long you have loved him   n     n     it has been coming on so gradually  that i hardly know when it began  n    but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds n    at pemberley   n     n    another entreaty that she would be serious  however  produced the n    desired effect  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances n    of attachment  when convinced on that article  miss bennet had nothing n    further to wish  n     n     now i am quite happy   said she   for you will be as happy as myself  n    i always had a value for him  were it for nothing but his love of you  n    i must always have esteemed him  but now  as bingley s friend and your n    husband  there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me  but n    lizzy  you have been very sly  very reserved with me  how little did you n    tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton  i owe all that i know n    of it to another  not to you   n     n    elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy  she had been unwilling n    to mention bingley  and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made n    her equally avoid the name of his friend  but now she would no longer n    conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage  all was acknowledged  n    and half the night spent in conversation  n     n                                        n     n     good gracious   cried mrs  bennet  as she stood at a window the next n    morning   if that disagreeable mr  darcy is not coming here again with n    our dear bingley  what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always n    coming here  i had no notion but he would go a-shooting  or something or n    other  and not disturb us with his company  what shall we do with him  n    lizzy  you must walk out with him again  that he may not be in bingley s n    way   n     n    elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal  yet n    was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an n    epithet  n     n    as soon as they entered  bingley looked at her so expressively  and n    shook hands with such warmth  as left no doubt of his good information  n    and he soon afterwards said aloud   mrs  bennet  have you no more lanes n    hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day   n     n     i advise mr  darcy  and lizzy  and kitty   said mrs  bennet   to walk n    to oakham mount this morning  it is a nice long walk  and mr  darcy has n    never seen the view   n     n     it may do very well for the others   replied mr  bingley   but i am n    sure it will be too much for kitty  won  t it  kitty   kitty owned that n    she had rather stay at home  darcy professed a great curiosity to see n    the view from the mount  and elizabeth silently consented  as she went n    up stairs to get ready  mrs  bennet followed her  saying  n     n     i am quite sorry  lizzy  that you should be forced to have that n    disagreeable man all to yourself  but i hope you will not mind it  it is n    all for jane s sake  you know  and there is no occasion for talking n    to him  except just now and then  so  do not put yourself to n    inconvenience   n     n    during their walk  it was resolved that mr  bennet s consent should be n    asked in the course of the evening  elizabeth reserved to herself the n    application for her mother s  she could not determine how her mother n    would take it  sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur n    would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man  but whether she n    were violently set against the match  or violently delighted with it  it n    was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit n    to her sense  and she could no more bear that mr  darcy should hear n    the first raptures of her joy  than the first vehemence of her n    disapprobation  n     n                                        n     n    in the evening  soon after mr  bennet withdrew to the library  she saw n    mr  darcy rise also and follow him  and her agitation on seeing it was n    extreme  she did not fear her father s opposition  but he was going to n    be made unhappy  and that it should be through her means--that  she   n    his favourite child  should be distressing him by her choice  should be n    filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched n    reflection  and she sat in misery till mr  darcy appeared again  when  n    looking at him  she was a little relieved by his smile  in a few minutes n    he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty  and  while n    pretending to admire her work said in a whisper   go to your father  he n    wants you in the library   she was gone directly  n     n    her father was walking about the room  looking grave and anxious  n     lizzy   said he   what are you doing  are you out of your senses  to be n    accepting this man  have not you always hated him   n     n    how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more n    reasonable  her expressions more moderate  it would have spared her from n    explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give  n    but they were now necessary  and she assured him  with some confusion  n    of her attachment to mr  darcy  n     n     or  in other words  you are determined to have him  he is rich  to be n    sure  and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane  n    but will they make you happy   n     n     have you any other objection   said elizabeth   than your belief of my n    indifference   n     n     none at all  we all know him to be a proud  unpleasant sort of man  but n    this would be nothing if you really liked him   n     n     i do  i do like him   she replied  with tears in her eyes   i love him  n    indeed he has no improper pride  he is perfectly amiable  you do not n    know what he really is  then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in n    such terms   n     n     lizzy   said her father   i have given him my consent  he is the kind n    of man  indeed  to whom i should never dare refuse anything  which he n    condescended to ask  i now give it to  you   if you are resolved on n    having him  but let me advise you to think better of it  i know n    your disposition  lizzy  i know that you could be neither happy nor n    respectable  unless you truly esteemed your husband  unless you looked n    up to him as a superior  your lively talents would place you in the n    greatest danger in an unequal marriage  you could scarcely escape n    discredit and misery  my child  let me not have the grief of seeing n     you  unable to respect your partner in life  you know not what you are n    about   n     n    elizabeth  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her reply  and n    at length  by repeated assurances that mr  darcy was really the object n    of her choice  by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of n    him had undergone  relating her absolute certainty that his affection n    was not the work of a day  but had stood the test of many months  n    suspense  and enumerating with energy all his good qualities  she did n    conquer her father s incredulity  and reconcile him to the match  n     n     well  my dear   said he  when she ceased speaking   i have no more to n    say  if this be the case  he deserves you  i could not have parted with n    you  my lizzy  to anyone less worthy   n     n    to complete the favourable impression  she then told him what mr  darcy n    had voluntarily done for lydia  he heard her with astonishment  n     n     this is an evening of wonders  indeed  and so  darcy did every thing  n    made up the match  gave the money  paid the fellow s debts  and got him n    his commission  so much the better  it will save me a world of trouble n    and economy  had it been your uncle s doing  i must and  would  have n    paid him  but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own n    way  i shall offer to pay him to-morrow  he will rant and storm about n    his love for you  and there will be an end of the matter   n     n    he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before  on his reading n    mr  collins s letter  and after laughing at her some time  allowed her n    at last to go--saying  as she quitted the room   if any young men come n    for mary or kitty  send them in  for i am quite at leisure   n     n    elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight  and  after n    half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room  she was able to join n    the others with tolerable composure  every thing was too recent for n    gaiety  but the evening passed tranquilly away  there was no longer n    anything material to be dreaded  and the comfort of ease and familiarity n    would come in time  n     n    when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night  she followed her  n    and made the important communication  its effect was most extraordinary  n    for on first hearing it  mrs  bennet sat quite still  and unable to n    utter a syllable  nor was it under many  many minutes that she could n    comprehend what she heard  though not in general backward to credit n    what was for the advantage of her family  or that came in the shape of a n    lover to any of them  she began at length to recover  to fidget about in n    her chair  get up  sit down again  wonder  and bless herself  n     n     good gracious  lord bless me  only think  dear me  mr  darcy  who would n    have thought it  and is it really true  oh  my sweetest lizzy  how rich n    and how great you will be  what pin-money  what jewels  what carriages n    you will have  jane s is nothing to it--nothing at all  i am so n    pleased--so happy  such a charming man --so handsome  so tall --oh  my n    dear lizzy  pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before  i n    hope he will overlook it  dear  dear lizzy  a house in town  every thing n    that is charming  three daughters married  ten thousand a year  oh  n    lord  what will become of me  i shall go distracted   n     n    this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted  and n    elizabeth  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself  n    soon went away  but before she had been three minutes in her own room  n    her mother followed her  n     n     my dearest child   she cried   i can think of nothing else  ten n    thousand a year  and very likely more   tis as good as a lord  and a n    special licence  you must and shall be married by a special licence  but n    my dearest love  tell me what dish mr  darcy is particularly fond of  n    that i may have it to-morrow   n     n    this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman n    himself might be  and elizabeth found that  though in the certain n    possession of his warmest affection  and secure of her relations  n    consent  there was still something to be wished for  but the morrow n    passed off much better than she expected  for mrs  bennet luckily stood n    in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to n    him  unless it was in her power to offer him any attention  or mark her n    deference for his opinion  n     n    elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get n    acquainted with him  and mr  bennet soon assured her that he was rising n    every hour in his esteem  n     n     i admire all my three sons-in-law highly   said he   wickham  perhaps  n    is my favourite  but i think i shall like  your  husband quite as well n    as jane  s   n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again  she wanted mr  n    darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her   how could n    you begin   said she   i can comprehend your going on charmingly  when n    you had once made a beginning  but what could set you off in the first n    place   n     n     i cannot fix on the hour  or the spot  or the look  or the words  which n    laid the foundation  it is too long ago  i was in the middle before i n    knew that i  had  begun   n     n     my beauty you had early withstood  and as for my manners--my behaviour n    to  you  was at least always bordering on the uncivil  and i never spoke n    to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not  now be sincere  n    did you admire me for my impertinence   n     n     for the liveliness of your mind  i did   n     n     you may as well call it impertinence at once  it was very little less  n    the fact is  that you were sick of civility  of deference  of officious n    attention  you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking  n    and looking  and thinking for  your  approbation alone  i roused  and n    interested you  because i was so unlike  them   had you not been really n    amiable  you would have hated me for it  but in spite of the pains you n    took to disguise yourself  your feelings were always noble and just  and n    in your heart  you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously n    courted you  there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for n    it  and really  all things considered  i begin to think it perfectly n    reasonable  to be sure  you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks n    of  that  when they fall in love   n     n     was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was n    ill at netherfield   n     n     dearest jane  who could have done less for her  but make a virtue of it n    by all means  my good qualities are under your protection  and you are n    to exaggerate them as much as possible  and  in return  it belongs to me n    to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may n    be  and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling n    to come to the point at last  what made you so shy of me  when you first n    called  and afterwards dined here  why  especially  when you called  did n    you look as if you did not care about me   n     n     because you were grave and silent  and gave me no encouragement   n     n     but i was embarrassed   n     n     and so was i   n     n     you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner   n     n     a man who had felt less  might   n     n     how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give  and that n    i should be so reasonable as to admit it  but i wonder how long you n     would  have gone on  if you had been left to yourself  i wonder when n    you  would  have spoken  if i had not asked you  my resolution of n    thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect  n     too much   i am afraid  for what becomes of the moral  if our comfort n    springs from a breach of promise  for i ought not to have mentioned the n    subject  this will never do   n     n     you need not distress yourself  the moral will be perfectly fair  lady n    catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of n    removing all my doubts  i am not indebted for my present happiness to n    your eager desire of expressing your gratitude  i was not in a humour n    to wait for any opening of yours  my aunt s intelligence had given me n    hope  and i was determined at once to know every thing   n     n     lady catherine has been of infinite use  which ought to make her happy  n    for she loves to be of use  but tell me  what did you come down to n    netherfield for  was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed  n    or had you intended any more serious consequence   n     n     my real purpose was to see  you   and to judge  if i could  whether i n    might ever hope to make you love me  my avowed one  or what i avowed to n    myself  was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley  n    and if she were  to make the confession to him which i have since made   n     n     shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to n    befall her   n     n     i am more likely to want more time than courage  elizabeth  but it n    ought to be done  and if you will give me a sheet of paper  it shall be n    done directly   n     n     and if i had not a letter to write myself  i might sit by you and n    admire the evenness of your writing  as another young lady once did  but n    i have an aunt  too  who must not be longer neglected   n     n    from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr  darcy n    had been over-rated  elizabeth had never yet answered mrs  gardiner s n    long letter  but now  having  that  to communicate which she knew would n    be most welcome  she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and n    aunt had already lost three days of happiness  and immediately wrote as n    follows  n     n     i would have thanked you before  my dear aunt  as i ought to have done  n    for your long  kind  satisfactory  detail of particulars  but to say the n    truth  i was too cross to write  you supposed more than really existed  n    but  now  suppose as much as you choose  give a loose rein to your n    fancy  indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the n    subject will afford  and unless you believe me actually married  you n    cannot greatly err  you must write again very soon  and praise him a n    great deal more than you did in your last  i thank you  again and again  n    for not going to the lakes  how could i be so silly as to wish it  your n    idea of the ponies is delightful  we will go round the park every day  i n    am the happiest creature in the world  perhaps other people have said so n    before  but not one with such justice  i am happier even than jane  she n    only smiles  i laugh  mr  darcy sends you all the love in the world that n    he can spare from me  you are all to come to pemberley at christmas  n    yours  etc   n     n    mr  darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style  and still n    different from either was what mr  bennet sent to mr  collins  in reply n    to his last  n     n     dear sir  n     n     i must trouble you once more for congratulations  elizabeth will soon n    be the wife of mr  darcy  console lady catherine as well as you can  n    but  if i were you  i would stand by the nephew  he has more to give  n     n     yours sincerely  etc   n     n    miss bingley s congratulations to her brother  on his approaching n    marriage  were all that was affectionate and insincere  she wrote even n    to jane on the occasion  to express her delight  and repeat all her n    former professions of regard  jane was not deceived  but she was n    affected  and though feeling no reliance on her  could not help writing n    her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved  n     n    the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information  n    was as sincere as her brother s in sending it  four sides of paper were n    insufficient to contain all her delight  and all her earnest desire of n    being loved by her sister  n     n    before any answer could arrive from mr  collins  or any congratulations n    to elizabeth from his wife  the longbourn family heard that the n    collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge  the reason of this n    sudden removal was soon evident  lady catherine had been rendered n    so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter  that n    charlotte  really rejoicing in the match  was anxious to get away till n    the storm was blown over  at such a moment  the arrival of her friend n    was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth  though in the course of their n    meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought  when she n    saw mr  darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of n    her husband  he bore it  however  with admirable calmness  he could even n    listen to sir william lucas  when he complimented him on carrying away n    the brightest jewel of the country  and expressed his hopes of their all n    meeting frequently at st  james s  with very decent composure  if he did n    shrug his shoulders  it was not till sir william was out of sight  n     n    mrs  phillips s vulgarity was another  and perhaps a greater  tax on his n    forbearance  and though mrs  phillips  as well as her sister  stood in n    too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good n    humour encouraged  yet  whenever she  did  speak  she must be vulgar  n    nor was her respect for him  though it made her more quiet  at all n    likely to make her more elegant  elizabeth did all she could to shield n    him from the frequent notice of either  and was ever anxious to keep n    him to herself  and to those of her family with whom he might converse n    without mortification  and though the uncomfortable feelings arising n    from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure  it n    added to the hope of the future  and she looked forward with delight to n    the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing n    to either  to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at n    pemberley  n     n     n     n    chapter    n     n     n    happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs  bennet got n    rid of her two most deserving daughters  with what delighted pride n    she afterwards visited mrs  bingley  and talked of mrs  darcy  may n    be guessed  i wish i could say  for the sake of her family  that the n    accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many n    of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible  n    amiable  well-informed woman for the rest of her life  though perhaps it n    was lucky for her husband  who might not have relished domestic felicity n    in so unusual a form  that she still was occasionally nervous and n    invariably silly  n     n    mr  bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly  his affection for her n    drew him oftener from home than anything else could do  he delighted in n    going to pemberley  especially when he was least expected  n     n    mr  bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth  so near n    a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to n     his  easy temper  or  her  affectionate heart  the darling wish of his n    sisters was then gratified  he bought an estate in a neighbouring county n    to derbyshire  and jane and elizabeth  in addition to every other source n    of happiness  were within thirty miles of each other  n     n    kitty  to her very material advantage  spent the chief of her time with n    her two elder sisters  in society so superior to what she had generally n    known  her improvement was great  she was not of so ungovernable a n    temper as lydia  and  removed from the influence of lydia s example  n    she became  by proper attention and management  less irritable  less n    ignorant  and less insipid  from the further disadvantage of lydia s n    society she was of course carefully kept  and though mrs  wickham n    frequently invited her to come and stay with her  with the promise of n    balls and young men  her father would never consent to her going  n     n    mary was the only daughter who remained at home  and she was necessarily n    drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs  bennet s being quite n    unable to sit alone  mary was obliged to mix more with the world  but n    she could still moralize over every morning visit  and as she was no n    longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters  beauty and her own  n    it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without n    much reluctance  n     n    as for wickham and lydia  their characters suffered no revolution from n    the marriage of her sisters  he bore with philosophy the conviction that n    elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude n    and falsehood had before been unknown to her  and in spite of every n    thing  was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on n    to make his fortune  the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received n    from lydia on her marriage  explained to her that  by his wife at least  n    if not by himself  such a hope was cherished  the letter was to this n    effect  n     n     my dear lizzy  n     n     i wish you joy  if you love mr  darcy half as well as i do my dear n    wickham  you must be very happy  it is a great comfort to have you so n    rich  and when you have nothing else to do  i hope you will think of us  n    i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much  and i do not n    think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help  n    any place would do  of about three or four hundred a year  but however  n    do not speak to mr  darcy about it  if you had rather not  n     n     yours  etc   n     n    as it happened that elizabeth had  much  rather not  she endeavoured in n    her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind  n    such relief  however  as it was in her power to afford  by the practice n    of what might be called economy in her own private expences  she n    frequently sent them  it had always been evident to her that such an n    income as theirs  under the direction of two persons so extravagant in n    their wants  and heedless of the future  must be very insufficient to n    their support  and whenever they changed their quarters  either jane or n    herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance n    towards discharging their bills  their manner of living  even when the n    restoration of peace dismissed them to a home  was unsettled in the n    extreme  they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap n    situation  and always spending more than they ought  his affection for n    her soon sunk into indifference  hers lasted a little longer  and n    in spite of her youth and her manners  she retained all the claims to n    reputation which her marriage had given her  n     n    though darcy could never receive  him  at pemberley  yet  for n    elizabeth s sake  he assisted him further in his profession  lydia was n    occasionally a visitor there  when her husband was gone to enjoy himself n    in london or bath  and with the bingleys they both of them frequently n    staid so long  that even bingley s good humour was overcome  and he n    proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone  n     n    miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage  but as she n    thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley  she n    dropt all her resentment  was fonder than ever of georgiana  almost as n    attentive to darcy as heretofore  and paid off every arrear of civility n    to elizabeth  n     n    pemberley was now georgiana s home  and the attachment of the sisters n    was exactly what darcy had hoped to see  they were able to love each n    other even as well as they intended  georgiana had the highest opinion n    in the world of elizabeth  though at first she often listened with n    an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively  sportive  manner of n    talking to her brother  he  who had always inspired in herself a respect n    which almost overcame her affection  she now saw the object of open n    pleasantry  her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen n    in her way  by elizabeth s instructions  she began to comprehend that n    a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not n    always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself  n     n    lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew  n    and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in n    her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement  she sent him n    language so very abusive  especially of elizabeth  that for some time n    all intercourse was at an end  but at length  by elizabeth s persuasion  n    he was prevailed on to overlook the offence  and seek a reconciliation  n    and  after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt  her n    resentment gave way  either to her affection for him  or her curiosity n    to see how his wife conducted herself  and she condescended to wait n    on them at pemberley  in spite of that pollution which its woods had n    received  not merely from the presence of such a mistress  but the n    visits of her uncle and aunt from the city  n     n    with the gardiners  they were always on the most intimate terms  n    darcy  as well as elizabeth  really loved them  and they were both ever n    sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who  by bringing n    her into derbyshire  had been the means of uniting them
